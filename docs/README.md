# TreasuryFlow — Documentation

## Two documentation layers

**`docs/`** — Human-readable reference documentation.
For humans who need to understand, deploy, or onboard to the project.
Contents: architecture diagrams, deployment guides, API conventions, onboarding.

**`knowledge/`** — AI-facing product context. The living wiki.
For AI coding agents (and humans) who need to know *what to build next*.
Contents: feature specs, platform requirements, API contracts, design decisions,
advisory board reviews. Maintained by the AI on every lifecycle operation.

Do not put feature specs or platform requirements in `docs/`. They belong in `knowledge/wiki/`.
Do not put architecture or deployment guides in `knowledge/`. They belong in `docs/`.

## What is in docs/

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/architecture.md` | System design, platform map, tech decisions |
| `docs/ai-agents.md` | How the agent system, commands, skills, and platform guidance fit together |
| `docs/api/conventions.md` | API naming, pagination, error format |
| `docs/deployment/ci-cd.md` | CI/CD setup and deployment pipelines |
| `backend/docs/azure-setup.md` | Azure Container Apps deployment |
| `backend/docs/entities/` | Database entity definitions and relationships |
| `docs/deployment/cloudflare-setup.md` | Cloudflare/OpenNext deployment |


## What is in knowledge/

See `knowledge/wiki/SCHEMA.md` for the complete wiki structure and operational rules.

The quick summary:
- `knowledge/wiki/features/` — one page per feature with spec, acceptance criteria, open questions
- `knowledge/wiki/platform-requirements/` — per-platform implementation specs
- `knowledge/wiki/api-contracts/` — API endpoint and data model contracts
- `knowledge/wiki/design/` — UI design decisions and component specs
- `knowledge/wiki/business-rules/` — invariants and constraints
- `knowledge/wiki/decisions/` — Architecture Decision Records
- `knowledge/wiki/advisory/` — advisory board configuration and review outputs
- `knowledge/wiki/index.md` — feature status board
- `knowledge/intake/` — raw inputs before AI processes them
