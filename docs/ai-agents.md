# AI Agents

This workspace includes a layered AI guidance system so Claude Code, Codex, Cursor,
and humans can all work from the same product and technical context.

## Purpose

The agent system in this workspace does four jobs:

1. give every agent a shared starting point
2. keep product work anchored to the living wiki in `knowledge/wiki/`
3. provide platform-specific implementation rules close to each codebase
4. package repeatable workflows into commands and reusable skills

## How The Layers Fit Together

## Commands Vs Skills

Commands and skills are related, but they are not the same thing:

- **Commands** are explicit operations invoked by name, mainly through Claude Code using `/command-name`.
- **Skills** are reusable guidance bundles that agents load when the work matches a workflow or platform need.

Surface split:

- [`.claude/commands/`](../.claude/commands/) powers Claude Code slash commands
- [`.claude/skills/`](../.claude/skills/) holds Claude Code skills
- [`.agents/skills/`](../.agents/skills/) holds Codex skills

Many lifecycle workflows appear in both places:

- as a Claude command for direct invocation
- as a Codex skill so the same workflow can be executed from Codex

## Command Surface

The command layer is mainly exposed through [`.claude/commands/`](../.claude/commands/).
These commands drive the Prism workflow around product intake, advisory review,
design handoff, delivery prep, and wiki maintenance.

Key command groups:

- setup: `setup-project`
- product workflow: `po-intake`, `po-clarify`, `po-handoff`
- design workflow: `design-intake`, `design-clarify`, `design-handoff`
- development helpers: `add-endpoint`, `document-entity`, `generate-clients`, `create-migration`
- delivery workflow: `prep-sprint`, `dev-done`
- governance and support: `board-review`, `feature-status`, `ask`, `audit-feature`, `lint-wiki`, `wiki-*`

Read [`CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md) for the command list by tool surface.

## Skill Map

The sections below describe the real skill sets on disk and what each one helps with.

### Codex Workflow Skills

These are the shared delivery skills under [`.agents/skills/`](../.agents/skills/) that
mirror much of the Claude command surface for Codex:

| Skill | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `setup-project` | Initializes the workspace wiki and advisory-board setup flow |
| `po-intake` | Converts raw product input into structured feature intake |
| `po-clarify` | Resolves product ambiguity before implementation starts |
| `po-handoff` | Finalizes product handoff into ready-for-design or ready-for-dev form |
| `design-intake` | Turns design input into structured workspace-ready design context |
| `design-clarify` | Resolves unclear design requirements and interaction decisions |
| `design-handoff` | Finalizes design guidance for development |
| `prep-sprint` | Read-only session view showing what is ready to build, blocked, or awaiting board review |
| `dev-done` | Wraps up delivery and updates project state |
| `board-review` | Runs a structured advisory-board review for domain-sensitive work; not for CRUD, auth, settings, or infrastructure |
| `ask` | Routes focused questions to the right delivery role |
| `audit-feature` | Reviews a feature against the workspace process and expectations |
| `feature-status` | Shows the full feature pipeline and refreshes `WIKI_REPORT.md` from current wiki state |
| `lint-wiki` | Checks the wiki for structure or consistency problems |
| `wiki-blockers` | Surfaces unresolved blockers from the wiki |
| `wiki-owner` | Read-only owner dashboard showing open questions, waiting work, and stale items for `po`, `designer`, or `dev` |

These skills support backend implementation. The `Surface` column shows whether the
skill is available to Claude Code, Codex, or both.

| Skill | Surface | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `spring-boot-conventions` | Claude, Codex | Core backend structure, layering, and framework usage rules |
| `security-auth` | Claude, Codex | Authentication, authorization, session, and security guidance |

| `error-handling` | Claude, Codex | Error-code, exception, and API error-response patterns |
| `testing-patterns` | Claude, Codex | Unit and integration testing strategy for the backend |
| `code-review` | Claude | Multi-perspective review across correctness, architecture, security, performance, and maintainability across platforms |



### Web Skills

The current web slices rely more on platform-local docs and agent files than on a large
dedicated web-only skill catalog.

Start with:

- [`CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md) for workspace-level workflow and command context
- [`docs/api/conventions.md`](api/conventions.md) for API usage rules
- [`shared/api-contracts/openapi.yml`](../shared/api-contracts/openapi.yml) for the source contract
- [`web-user-app/docs/guide.md`](../web-user-app/docs/guide.md) for the user web slice
- [`web-admin-portal/docs/guide.md`](../web-admin-portal/docs/guide.md) for the admin web slice
- the local `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` files inside each web slice



### Android Skills

| Skill | Surface | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `android-conventions` | Claude, Codex | Architecture, naming, folder layout, and state-management rules |
| `android-feature-delivery` | Claude, Codex | End-to-end Android feature implementation workflow |
| `android-testing` | Claude, Codex | Unit, UI, and verification testing guidance |
| `android-build-verify` | Claude, Codex | Local build and verification checklist before handoff |
| `android-contract-alignment` | Claude, Codex | Keep Android models and networking aligned with the OpenAPI contract |
| `deploy-device` | Claude | Build, install, and launch the app on a connected Android device or emulator via `adb` |
| `compose-design-system` | Claude, Codex | Jetpack Compose design-system and UI composition guidance |



### iOS Skills

| Skill | Surface | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `ios-conventions` | Claude, Codex | iOS architecture, naming, file placement, and state-management rules |
| `ios-feature-delivery` | Claude, Codex | End-to-end iOS feature implementation workflow |
| `ios-testing` | Claude, Codex | Unit, UI, and verification testing guidance |
| `ios-build-verify` | Claude, Codex | Local build and verification checklist before handoff |
| `ios-contract-alignment` | Claude, Codex | Keep iOS models and networking aligned with the OpenAPI contract |
| `swiftui-design-system` | Claude, Codex | SwiftUI design-system and view-composition guidance |


## How To Work With The Agents

1. Start with [`CONTEXT.md`](../CONTEXT.md).
2. Read [`knowledge/wiki/index.md`](../knowledge/wiki/index.md) and the relevant feature page.
3. Read the platform-local `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and `docs/guide.md` files for the slice you are changing.
4. Use the command layer for lifecycle work such as setup, intake, review, and completion.
5. Use the skill folders as implementation guidance, not as a replacement for the wiki.

## When Humans Should Read This

This document is especially useful for:

- product managers who want to understand how Prism structures AI-assisted delivery
