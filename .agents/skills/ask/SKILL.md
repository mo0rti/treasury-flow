description: Route a question to PO, designer, or dev by adding it to a feature's open questions table and appending the change to the wiki log.

# Ask

Use this skill to record and route one explicit open question for a feature.

## Usage

`$ask [F-XXX] "[question text]" --to po|designer|dev`

## Workflow

1. Read the feature file
2. Add the next question row to the open questions table
3. Set the owner from `--to` and the status to `open`
4. Show the updated table for confirmation
5. After confirmation, update the feature file and append to `log.md`

## Rules

- write-capable skill
- supported owner values are exactly `po`, `designer`, and `dev`
- do not infer the owner automatically
- do not write the updated question table until the user confirms it

## Canonical format reference

Mirror the detailed workflow and write behavior from:

- `/.claude/commands/ask.md`

## Output behavior

Return:

- feature ID and title
- the new question row
- the updated open questions table before writing

## Error and stop conditions

- if the feature file does not exist, return a clean missing-feature response
- if `--to` is invalid, return a clean invalid-owner response
- if the user does not confirm the updated table, stop without writing
