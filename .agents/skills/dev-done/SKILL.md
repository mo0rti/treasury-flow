# Dev Done

Use this skill to mark one feature as shipped and close out its implementation state.

## Usage

`$dev-done [F-XXX]`

## Workflow

1. Read the feature file
2. Ask the user for deviations, lessons learned, or board-review outcomes worth recording
3. If needed, add `## Post-ship notes`
4. Update the feature status to `done` and owner to `none`
5. Update matching platform-requirements pages to `done`
6. Update the API contract page to `implemented` if one exists
7. Update `index.md` and append to `log.md`

## Rules

- write-capable skill
- ask for post-ship notes before changing the final status
- record meaningful deviations from the spec instead of silently dropping them
- if a board review happened, ask whether any concerns materialized or proved unfounded

## Canonical format reference

Mirror the detailed workflow and write behavior from:

- `/.claude/commands/dev-done.md`

## Output behavior

Return:

- feature being closed out
- any post-ship notes recorded
- pages whose status changed
- final status summary

## Error and stop conditions

- if the feature file does not exist, return a clean missing-feature response
- if the user wants to cancel instead of marking the feature done, stop without writing
