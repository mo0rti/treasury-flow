# Design Intake

Use this skill to process one pending design intake folder for one feature.

## Usage

`$design-intake [F-XXX] [folder-name]`

## Workflow

1. Read `knowledge/wiki/SCHEMA.md`
2. Read the feature file
3. Read `knowledge/wiki/business-rules/`
4. Read the advisory review for the feature if one exists
5. Read all files in `knowledge/intake/pending/[folder-name]/`
6. Show the user an interpretation summary and wait for confirmation
7. If confirmed, create the design page
8. Update the feature file's design section
9. Add designer-owned open questions for uncovered UI states
10. Update `index.md`, append to `log.md`, and move the intake folder to `processed/` or `quarantined/` as appropriate

## Rules

- write-capable skill
- do not write anything until the user confirms the interpretation summary
- flag any conflicts with the feature spec, business rules, ADRs, or board review findings before writing
- if a board review exists, check whether the design addresses those concerns
- note Figma links as references even when the content cannot be read directly

## Canonical format reference

Mirror the detailed workflow and write behavior from:

- `/.claude/commands/design-intake.md`

## Output behavior

Return:

- interpretation summary before writes
- design decisions extracted
- covered and missing UI states
- any conflicts found
- created design page path and any open questions added

## Error and stop conditions

- if the feature file or intake folder does not exist, return a clean missing-input response
- if the user does not confirm the interpretation summary, stop without writing
- if conflicts require quarantine, stop after reporting them
