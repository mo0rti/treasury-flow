# Feature Status

Show the current pipeline view and refresh the generated orientation report.

This skill intentionally allows implicit invocation because it only refreshes the
generated `knowledge/wiki/WIKI_REPORT.md` orientation artifact. That report is
regenerable, gitignored, and not the source of truth for project state.

## Workflow

1. Read `knowledge/wiki/SCHEMA.md`
2. Read `knowledge/wiki/SETTINGS.md` if present
3. Read `knowledge/wiki/index.md`
4. Read all feature files in `knowledge/wiki/features/`
5. Read linked design, platform-requirements, api-contract, advisory-review, and
   business-rule files as needed to compute blocker counts, open-question counts, and
   recently updated pages
6. Output the full pipeline view grouped by status
7. Write or refresh `knowledge/wiki/WIKI_REPORT.md`

## WIKI_REPORT rules

- only `$feature-status` writes `knowledge/wiki/WIKI_REPORT.md`
- `WIKI_REPORT.md` is generated and read-only
- it is an orientation artifact, not the source of truth
- if it disagrees with the underlying wiki files, the underlying wiki files win
- include a short pointer to run `lint-wiki` for structural issues
- do not put full lint conclusions into `WIKI_REPORT.md`

If `knowledge/wiki/SETTINGS.md` is absent or invalid, fall back to
`wiki-stale-after-days: 14` and tell the user.

## Canonical format reference

Mirror the detailed output contract from:

- `/.claude/commands/feature-status.md`

In particular, keep the generated `WIKI_REPORT.md` sections aligned with the Claude command.

## Output format

```text

## Open questions by owner
### PO
- F-XXX - [question text]

### Designer
- F-XXX - [question text]

### Developer
- F-XXX - [question text]

## Blocker snapshot
- pending-board-review: N
- missing-design: N
- missing-platform-requirements: N
- unresolved-open-questions: N

## WIKI_REPORT required sections
- Project summary
- Features by lifecycle stage
- Advisory review snapshot
- Open questions by owner
- Blocker snapshot
- Recently updated wiki pages
- Structural health pointer
- Suggested next actions

WIKI_REPORT refreshed:
- knowledge/wiki/WIKI_REPORT.md

Next drill-down tools:
- $wiki-show F-XXX
- $wiki-blockers
```

## Notes

- Do not modify feature files, index.md, or log.md in this operation.
- Only write `knowledge/wiki/WIKI_REPORT.md`.
- If report refresh fails, still return the pipeline view and state that the refresh failed.
