# PO Handoff

Use this skill to move one feature into `ready-for-design`.

## Usage

`$po-handoff [F-XXX]`

## Workflow

1. Read the feature file
2. Check `advisory-review` first and handle board-review branching if needed
3. Run the completeness check after any board-review-generated questions are visible
4. If the feature is incomplete, report the missing items and stop
5. If complete, show the proposed status and owner change and wait for confirmation
6. After confirmation, update the feature file, update `index.md`, append to `log.md`, and output a design brief

## Rules

- write-capable skill
- if `advisory-review: pending`, either route through board review or require an explicit skip reason
- do not hand off a feature with open PO-owned questions
- require at least one platform in scope before handoff
- do not write status changes until the user confirms the handoff
- make the design brief readable without requiring the designer to parse the full feature file first

## Canonical format reference

Mirror the detailed workflow and write behavior from:

- `/.claude/commands/po-handoff.md`

## Output behavior

Return:

- advisory-review result
- completeness result
- missing blockers if the feature is not ready
- proposed status and owner change
- design brief after confirmation

## Error and stop conditions

- if the feature file does not exist, return a clean missing-feature response
- if the feature fails the completeness check, stop without writing
- if the user does not confirm the handoff, stop without writing
