# Design Handoff

Use this skill to move one feature into `ready-for-dev` and generate platform requirements.

## Usage

`$design-handoff [F-XXX]`

## Workflow

1. Read the feature file
2. Read the linked design file if one exists
3. Determine whether UI platforms are in scope
4. Run the completeness check for design coverage, open questions, and current status
5. Check the `advisory-review` state and stop or branch as required
6. If the feature is incomplete, report what is missing and stop
7. If complete, show the proposed status and owner change and wait for confirmation
8. After confirmation, update the feature file, generate platform-requirements pages, update `index.md`, and append to `log.md`

## Rules

- write-capable skill
- do not hand off an incomplete feature
- if UI platforms are in scope, a design decision or explicit `design: not-applicable` reason must exist
- if `advisory-review: pending`, stop and route through board review or require an explicit skip reason
- if board review actions required before development remain open, list them before proceeding
- do not write status changes or platform requirements until the user confirms the handoff

## Canonical format reference

Mirror the detailed workflow and write behavior from:

- `/.claude/commands/design-handoff.md`

## Output behavior

Return:

- completeness result
- advisory-review result
- any blocking missing items
- proposed status and owner change
- generated platform-requirements targets after confirmation

## Error and stop conditions

- if the feature file does not exist, return a clean missing-feature response
- if required design or advisory prerequisites are not met, stop without writing
- if the user does not confirm the handoff, stop without writing
