# iOS Contract Alignment

Use this skill when backend-facing iOS code changes.

## Role boundary

- Own request and response shapes, endpoint mapping, repository-to-model translation, and auth-boundary wiring.
- Defer screen structure and general workflow to companion iOS skills.

## Rules

- Keep API-aligned models in `Domain/Model/`.
- Keep endpoint definitions in `Data/Network/APIEndpoint.swift`.
- Keep transport logic in `APIClient`.
- Keep repository mapping logic in `Data/Repository/`, not in views.
- The runtime base URL already includes `/api/v1`, so endpoint paths append feature-relative routes such as `/auth/...` or `/transactions/...`.
- Auth headers come from `TokenStorage` through `APIClient`; do not add ad hoc token plumbing in features.
- The default baseline for `APIError.unauthorized` is: clear `TokenStorage` and route the app back to login.
- `AuthRepository.refreshToken()` exists as a named extension point, but automatic refresh-and-retry is not scaffolded into `APIClient` by default.
- If a project adds refresh-and-retry later, centralize that behavior in `APIClient` or another transport-boundary abstraction rather than scattering retry logic across features.
- Coordinate refresh-and-retry so concurrent 401 responses await one in-flight refresh operation instead of triggering parallel refresh attempts.
- If the project starts using covered required-reason APIs or adds third-party SDKs that declare privacy usage, update `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` rather than hiding that work inside feature code.
- Keep client error flow consistent: `APIClient` maps transport failures, repositories translate only when needed, ViewModels map errors into view state, and views render shared loading or error patterns.

## Reference files

Load only the reference file the task needs:

- `references/token-refresh-patterns.md` for actor-safe refresh coordination, retry boundaries, and the simultaneous-401 race
- `references/privacy-manifest.md` for required-reason API categories, third-party SDK checks, and `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` update guidance

## Cross-check sources

- Use `shared/api-contracts/openapi.yml` as the primary source for endpoint shapes.
- Use `backend/` to confirm behavior when the spec is ambiguous.
- Use `mobile-android/` to confirm parity expectations when iOS should mirror Android behavior.


## Validation

- Run `task mobile-ios:build` on Mac after contract changes.
- Read `mobile-ios/docs/networking-and-auth.md` and `mobile-ios/docs/session-and-token-storage.md` when auth, token, or session behavior changes.
