# Design Clarify

Use this skill to work through open designer-owned questions one feature at a time.

## Usage

`$design-clarify`

## Workflow

1. Read `knowledge/wiki/SCHEMA.md`
2. Read all feature files
3. Collect open questions where owner = `designer` and status = `open`
4. Present the questions grouped by feature, one feature at a time
5. For each answer:
   - update the open questions table in the feature file
   - update the design page when the answer reveals missing design detail or resolves a state gap
6. Update `index.md` if any feature status changes
7. Append a summary entry to `log.md`

## Rules

- write-capable skill
- present questions one feature at a time
- confirm each update before moving to the next question
- flag board-generated questions clearly and treat them as high priority
- update the design page when answers resolve previously missing UI states
- if one feature hits a contradiction or missing-page blocker, stop updates for that feature only
- do not stop the whole clarify session unless the user asks to stop

## Canonical format reference

Mirror the detailed workflow and write behavior from:

- `/.claude/commands/design-clarify.md`

## Output behavior

Return:

- current feature being clarified
- open designer questions for that feature
- design-page and feature-file updates made from each answer
- final summary of questions resolved

## Error and stop conditions

- if there are no open designer questions, return a clean empty-state response
- if a required design page is missing for a design-state update, report that cleanly and stop updates for that feature, then continue with the next feature unless the user wants to stop
