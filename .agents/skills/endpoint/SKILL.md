description: Create or extend a REST API endpoint in the backend. Use when adding backend routes, request or response DTOs, service methods, persistence support, or matching OpenAPI contract changes under `backend/` and `shared/api-contracts/`.

# Endpoint

Use this skill when a backend API endpoint needs to be added or materially changed.

## Workflow

1. Identify the target domain module under `modules/<domain>/` and confirm feature context from the wiki and local backend docs as needed.
2. Add or update the matching OpenAPI path and schemas in `shared/api-contracts/openapi.yml`.
3. Run `task generate-clients` so generated clients stay aligned with the contract.
4. Create or update the controller in `controller/` using the project's Spring conventions.
5. Create request and response DTOs in `dto/`.
6. Create or update the service in `service/`.
7. Create or update persistence in `model/` and `repository/` if storage changes are required.
8. Consider security, validation, pagination, and error handling before finishing.
9. Add a migration when the endpoint requires schema changes.

## Cross-Checks

- Follow `$spring-boot-conventions` for structure and controller or service patterns.
- Follow `$security-auth` when auth requirements or public/private route exposure changes.
- Follow `$error-handling` when adding error codes, new exception paths, or validation behavior.
- Follow local backend docs and neighboring modules before introducing a new pattern.

## Output

- Updated OpenAPI contract
- Updated backend controller, service, DTOs, and persistence as needed
- A note on any required migration, security, or validation follow-up
