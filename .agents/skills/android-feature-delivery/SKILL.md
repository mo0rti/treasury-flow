description: Cross-layer feature orchestration for Android. Use when a task spans multiple layers and needs scoped planning, companion-skill selection, validation, and documentation updates across DTOs, APIs, repositories, ViewModels, Compose UI, navigation, resources, and docs.

# Android Feature Delivery

Use this skill to coordinate non-trivial feature work that crosses layers.

## Role boundary

- Use this skill as the delivery checklist and orchestration layer for multi-step work.
- Pull in companion skills for detailed rules instead of restating repository, contract, UI, or verification conventions here.

## Request

$ARGUMENTS

## 1. Research the current shape

- Inspect the surrounding feature under `feature/`, plus shared code in `designsystem/`, `core/`, and `navigation/`.
- Read only the docs needed for the task, starting with `mobile-android/docs/conventions-and-workflow.md` and `mobile-android/docs/architecture.md`.
- Reuse nearby patterns before inventing a new one.

## 2. Verify external contracts

- Cross-check the OpenAPI spec in `shared/api-contracts/openapi.yml` when endpoints, DTOs, or enums are involved.
- Cross-check the backend in `backend/` when behavior or response shapes need confirmation.


## 3. Map affected layers

Cover only the layers the feature truly needs:

- DTOs and enums
- Retrofit API and network service
- Repository updates
- ViewModel state, events, and intent methods
- Compose screens and shared components
- Navigation routes and callbacks
- Resources such as strings, icons, or drawables
- Documentation updates in `mobile-android/docs/`

## 4. Use the right companion skills

- Use `$android-conventions` for repository-wide MVVM, DI, navigation, string, and doc-sync rules.
- Use `$android-contract-alignment` for DTO, enum, Retrofit, and auth-boundary decisions.
- Use `$compose-design-system` for shared UI language, reusable Compose primitives, and screen-level pattern reuse.
- Use `$android-testing` for Compose UI test patterns, ViewModel coroutine testing, and Hilt-aware instrumentation setup.
- Use `$android-build-verify` to choose the smallest trustworthy Gradle validation.

## 5. Execute and close out

- Implement only the layers the feature actually touches.
- If ViewModel or repository logic is added or changed, add at least one targeted unit test and confirm it passes with `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest` (or `gradlew.bat testDebugUnitTest` on Windows) before close-out.
- If UI or a new Activity is added or changed, confirm `enableEdgeToEdge()` is called in the owning activity, `Scaffold` insets are handled through its `PaddingValues`, and accessibility semantics, touch targets, and text-scale resilience are still correct before close-out.
- If resources, manifests, or accessibility-sensitive UI change, include `lintDebug` or a stronger validation task from `$android-build-verify`.
- Run at least `./gradlew compileDebugKotlin` (or `gradlew.bat` on Windows), plus stronger targeted verification when the change crosses logic, packaging, or integration boundaries.
- Update any affected docs in `mobile-android/docs/` in the same session.
