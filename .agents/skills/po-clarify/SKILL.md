# PO Clarify

Use this skill to work through open PO-owned questions one feature at a time.

## Usage

`$po-clarify`

## Workflow

1. Read `knowledge/wiki/SCHEMA.md`
2. Read all feature files
3. Collect open questions where owner = `po` and status = `open`
4. Present the questions grouped by feature, one feature at a time
5. For each answer:
   - update the open questions table
   - update the feature spec if the answer introduces a new requirement
   - flag the conflict and leave the question open if the answer contradicts existing wiki content
6. Update `index.md` if owner or status changes
7. Append a single summary entry to `log.md`

## Rules

- write-capable skill
- present questions one feature at a time, not as one large dump
- confirm each update before moving to the next question
- if an answer introduces a new open question, add it immediately
- treat board-generated questions with the same priority as other open questions
- if one feature hits a contradiction, skip that conflicting answer and leave the question open for that feature only
- do not stop the whole clarify session unless the user asks to stop

## Canonical format reference

Mirror the detailed workflow and write behavior from:

- `/.claude/commands/po-clarify.md`

## Output behavior

Return:

- current feature being clarified
- open questions for that feature
- resolved answers and resulting wiki updates
- any newly added open questions
- final summary of questions resolved

## Error and stop conditions

- if there are no open PO questions, return a clean empty-state response
- if a user answer conflicts with existing wiki content, report the conflict, leave that question open, and stop the conflicting update for that feature, then continue with the next feature unless the user wants to stop
