# iOS Testing

Use this skill when iOS work needs test coverage, test refactors, or test-shape decisions.

## Role boundary

- Own test authoring patterns for unit tests and UI tests.
- Defer production architecture rules to `$ios-conventions`.
- Defer transport and auth-boundary rules to `$ios-contract-alignment`.
- Defer shared UI behavior and accessibility rules to `$swiftui-design-system`.
- Defer task selection and Mac-only verification decisions to `$ios-build-verify`.

## Unit-test rules

- Prefer unit tests for ViewModel state, repository mapping, auth-state transitions, and helper logic.
- Keep `@MainActor` on tests that exercise `@MainActor @Observable` ViewModels so state mutations stay concurrency-correct.
- Mirror the generated pattern of file-local mock repositories unless a broader shared fake clearly improves the suite.
- Use `task mobile-ios:test-unit` as the default verification step after logic-only test changes.

## Swift Testing guidance

- XCTest remains the scaffolded baseline and is always acceptable.
- Swift Testing can be added incrementally for new logic-focused suites; it can coexist with XCTest in the same generated project.
- Prefer consistency within a given feature's tests instead of rewriting existing XCTest files just to adopt Swift Testing.

## UI-test rules

- Use UI tests for auth gating, app launch mode, critical navigation, accessibility identifiers, and other user-visible flow transitions.
- Preserve stable accessibility identifiers on screen roots and critical controls that generated UI tests depend on.
- Treat the generated UI suite as a smoke baseline, not exhaustive flow coverage. Extend it when new screens or critical flows are added.
- Use `task mobile-ios:test-ui` when screen structure, app-launch behavior, auth gating, or identifier wiring changes.

## Picking the right test

- If the change is ViewModel or repository logic: add or update a unit test first.
- If the change is app flow, auth gating, screen structure, or identifiers: add or update a UI test when the behavior is not already covered.
- If both logic and UI are touched, prefer a unit test for the logic plus the smallest UI smoke test that protects the user flow.

## Validation

- Use `$ios-build-verify` to choose the smallest trustworthy validation after editing tests.
