# Android Contract Alignment

Use this skill when backend-facing Android code changes.

## Scope

- Own request and response shapes, enums, Retrofit endpoints, and auth-related contract wiring.
- Defer screen structure, design-system reuse, and general repository workflow to `$android-conventions`.

## DTO and Enum Rules

- Keep DTOs in `feature/*/data/remote/dto/` when the payload is feature-specific.
- Keep shared DTOs in `core/model/` when multiple features consume the same shape.
- DTOs use `@Serializable`; do not use Gson or Moshi annotations.
- Domain models in `feature/*/domain/` stay framework-light.
- Map DTOs to domain models in the repository layer, not in ViewModels.

## Retrofit and Service Rules

- Retrofit API interfaces live in `feature/*/data/remote/api/` or `core/network/`.
- API base URL comes from the shared network configuration; do not hardcode URLs.
- Auth headers come from `AuthInterceptor` reading `TokenStorage`; do not add ad hoc token plumbing in features.
- Token refresh is handled by `TokenAuthenticator`; features do not handle `401` refresh logic directly, and refresh failure falls back to `SessionManager.onLogout()`.

## Cross-Check Sources

- Use `shared/api-contracts/openapi.yml` as the primary source for endpoint shapes.
- Use `backend/` to confirm behavior when the spec is ambiguous.


## Validation

- Run `./gradlew compileDebugKotlin` or `gradlew.bat compileDebugKotlin` after contract changes.
- Add targeted tests when mapper or repository logic changes.
