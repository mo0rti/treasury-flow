description: Regenerate typed API clients from `shared/api-contracts/openapi.yml` after contract changes. Use when endpoints, schemas, enums, auth payloads, or API conventions change and downstream generated clients must stay in sync.

# Generate API Clients

Use this skill after changing the OpenAPI contract or anything derived from it.

This skill intentionally allows implicit invocation because it is deterministic code
generation and verification, not a product-wiki lifecycle state transition.

## Workflow

1. Validate the contract with `task validate-api`.
2. Run `task generate-clients`.
3. Verify the generated output for the relevant platforms only:
- `task backend:build`
- `task web-user-app:build`
- `task web-admin-portal:build`
- `task mobile-android:build`
- `task mobile-ios:build` (Mac only)

4. If generation or verification fails, report the first blocking error and stop before hand-editing generated code.

## Output

- The platforms whose clients were regenerated
- Whether validation and build verification passed
- Any manual follow-up still required
