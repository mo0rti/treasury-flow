# Setup Project

Run this skill once immediately after `copier copy` scaffolds the project.
It initializes the wiki and generates the domain-specific advisory board.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Project identity confirmation

Read:
- `CONTEXT.md` (the rendered monorepo root context file)
- `.copier-answers.yml` if present (Copier-generated answers file)
- Any existing docs/ or README files

Present a confirmation summary: project name, description, platforms included, any
pre-existing structure. Ask: "Is this correct? Is there anything important not captured?"

Wait for confirmation before proceeding to Step 2.

### Step 2: Domain risk interview

Ask these four questions one at a time. Wait for each answer before asking the next:

1. "Who are your primary users, and what do they trust this app to get right?"
2. "What is the most important decision or calculation this app makes on behalf of users?"
3. "What could go wrong if the app gets that wrong? The worst realistic case?"
4. "Are there any user groups who might be especially vulnerable to a mistake?"

After all answers, summarize the domain risks and expertise gaps implied. Confirm
understanding before proceeding to Step 3.

### Step 3: Advisory board generation

Propose a board of 4–6 members. For each member provide:
- Name (realistic fictional person), Title, Institution
- Expertise: 3–5 bullet points
- Why on this board: one sentence connecting to a specific failure mode from Step 2
- Typical questions they ask: 2–3 concrete, domain-specific questions

Present all members and ask for confirmation, additions, and removals.
Revise until the team confirms.

**Only write BOARD.md after explicit confirmation.**

### Step 4: Initial wiki scaffolding

After confirmation:
- Write `knowledge/wiki/advisory/BOARD.md` with confirmed board
- Write initial `knowledge/wiki/index.md` (empty status board)
- Write initial `knowledge/wiki/log.md` with initialization entry
- Create any business rule entries revealed during interview
- Create any user persona stubs revealed during interview

Show a summary of everything created. Append initialization entry to log.md.

## Notes

- Ask Step 2 questions one at a time in conversation — never as a form.
- 4–6 board members is the right range for small teams.
- The "typical questions" are the most important part — they train the AI reviewer.
- Never skip Step 3 confirmation. A board the team didn't help define will be dismissed.
