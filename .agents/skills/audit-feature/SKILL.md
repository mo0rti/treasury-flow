# Audit Feature

Use this skill to audit one feature against its source documents.

## Usage

`$audit-feature [F-XXX]`

## Workflow

1. Read the feature file
2. Read its `sources` frontmatter
3. Read all listed source files
4. Compare the feature spec to the sources
5. Report findings as Confirmed, Untraced, Missed, and Drifted
6. Append the audit result to `log.md`

## Rules

- write-capable skill for `log.md` only
- do not auto-fix the feature spec during the audit
- treat untraced requirements as the highest-signal risk
- if a board review exists, include traceability context where relevant

## Canonical format reference

Mirror the detailed workflow and output framing from:

- `/.claude/commands/audit-feature.md`

## Output behavior

Return:

- confirmed requirements with source traceability
- untraced requirements
- missed source items
- drifted items
- recommended follow-up questions for the team when needed

## Error and stop conditions

- if the feature file does not exist, return a clean missing-feature response
- if the feature has no `sources` field or the listed source files cannot be found, report the traceability gap clearly
- do not rewrite the feature spec as part of the audit
