# Prep Sprint

Read-only command. Shows the current buildable state of the product wiki.

## Workflow

1. Read `knowledge/wiki/WIKI_REPORT.md` first if it exists for a quick orientation summary
2. If `knowledge/wiki/WIKI_REPORT.md` is absent, tell the user to run `$feature-status`
   first so the orientation report exists on demand
3. Read `knowledge/wiki/SCHEMA.md`
4. Read `knowledge/wiki/index.md`
5. Read all feature files with status `ready-for-dev` or `in-dev`
6. For each feature, read its platform-requirements pages

## Canonical format reference

Mirror the detailed output contract from:

- `/.claude/commands/prep-sprint.md`

## Output format

```
## Ready to build

### F-XXX — [Feature Title] [ready-for-dev]
Platforms: [platform list]
Design: knowledge/wiki/design/F-XXX-[slug].md (or "not applicable")
Board review: done | not-needed | skipped
Requirements:
- [platform]: knowledge/wiki/platform-requirements/F-XXX-[platform].md
Open dev questions: [count or "none"]
Dependencies: [feature IDs or "none"]

## Blocked (has dev-owned open questions)
- F-XXX — [title]: "[question text] [dev, open]"

## Board review pending (not ready for dev)
- F-XXX — [title] [status, advisory-review: pending]

## Not ready (in earlier lifecycle stages)
- F-XXX — [title] [status, owner: role]
```

## Notes

- Do not modify any wiki files. This is a read-only operation.
- `WIKI_REPORT.md` is an orientation artifact, not the source of truth.
- Features with `advisory-review: pending` must NOT appear in "Ready to build."
- State explicitly if any ready-for-dev feature has no platform-requirements pages.
- Check and state dependencies explicitly.
