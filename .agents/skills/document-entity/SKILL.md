# Document Entity

Use this skill to create or update one backend entity documentation page.

## Usage

`$document-entity`

If the entity name and fields are not already provided, ask the user for them first.

## Workflow

1. Ask for the entity name and fields if they were not provided
2. Create or update `backend/docs/entities/{entity-name}.md`
3. Use `backend/docs/entities/_template.md` as the baseline structure
4. Fill in:
   - entity name and description
   - fields with types, constraints, and defaults
   - relationships to other entities
   - validation rules and business logic
   - database notes and indexes
5. If this is a new entity, add it to `docs/architecture.md`
6. Check `knowledge/wiki/features/` for feature pages that reference the entity
7. If feature-page updates appear necessary, show them as a separate proposed follow-up and wait for confirmation before writing those wiki changes

## Rules

- write-capable skill
- ask for missing entity details instead of inventing them
- use the entity template structure unless the project already has an established variant
- if feature pages need updates, keep them aligned with the documented entity shape but confirm those wiki writes separately
- do not silently skip architecture updates for new entities

## Canonical format reference

Mirror the detailed workflow from:

- `/.claude/commands/document-entity.md`

## Output behavior

Return:

- entity name and target doc path
- whether the entity doc was created or updated
- architecture doc changes if any
- any proposed or applied feature-page updates to stay aligned

## Error and stop conditions

- if the entity name is missing, ask for it before writing
- if the field list is incomplete, ask for clarification instead of inventing schema details
