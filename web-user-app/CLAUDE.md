# User Web App

Next.js App Router project for the user-facing web surface.

## Product knowledge wiki

This project uses a shared product wiki at `knowledge/wiki/` as the single source of
truth for what to build. Before implementing any feature:

1. Read `knowledge/wiki/index.md` — confirm the feature is in `ready-for-dev` or `in-dev`
   status and that `advisory-review` is not `pending`. If `advisory-review` is `pending`,
   stop and inform the human — a board review should happen before implementation.
2. Read `knowledge/wiki/features/[feature-id]-[slug].md` for full context
3. Read `knowledge/wiki/platform-requirements/[feature-id]-web-user-app.md` for
   web app-specific implementation requirements
4. Read `knowledge/wiki/api-contracts/[feature-id].md` if this feature has an API surface
5. Check `knowledge/wiki/business-rules/` for rules that apply to this feature
6. Read `knowledge/wiki/design/[feature-id]-[slug].md` for UI design decisions

**Do not implement features without a wiki page.** Ask the human to run the `po-intake`
operation first (Claude: `/po-intake [folder]`, Codex: `$po-intake [folder]`,
Cursor: ask the agent to "run po-intake on [folder]").

If you discover information during implementation that should update the wiki, propose
the update and ask for confirmation before writing, or route a question using the `ask`
command (Claude: `/ask F-XXX "..." --to po`, Codex: `$ask F-XXX "..." --to po`).

This slice is based on the Ingredish client-web structure:

- locale-aware routing with `next-intl`
- public marketing routes plus authenticated dashboard routes
- NextAuth for web session handling
- `/api/v1/*` proxy routes for backend integration
- Cloudflare/OpenNext deployment

## Focus Areas

- Keep public routes polished and content-first.
- Keep dashboard routes product-focused, not admin-focused.
- Prefer route handlers and shared helpers over duplicating fetch logic.
- Treat auth provider buttons and credentials flows as user-facing UX, not internal tooling.

## Key Paths

- `app/[locale]/` - locale-aware user routes
- `app/[locale]/dashboard/` - authenticated product shell
- `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` - NextAuth route handlers
- `app/api/v1/[...path]/route.ts` - backend proxy
- `auth.ts` - web session configuration
- `lib/i18n/` - locale config and routing helpers
