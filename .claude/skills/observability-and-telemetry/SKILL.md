# Observability & Telemetry (TreasuryFlow Backend)

Use this skill when backend work affects logging, metrics, traces, Actuator
exposure, async execution, or operational debugging expectations.

## Role Boundary

- Use this skill for telemetry design, instrumentation decisions, structured
  logging, and context propagation.
- Use `spring-boot-conventions` for controller/service structure.
- Use `security-auth` for auth mechanics and route exposure.
- Use `authorization-rules` for business access policy and ownership checks.
- Use `error-handling` for API error payload shape and exception modeling.

## Current Platform Assumptions

- Spring Boot 4.x on the servlet stack
- Micrometer / Actuator conventions are the baseline
- Built-in framework instrumentation should be preferred before adding custom
  instrumentation
- TreasuryFlow is a finance operations product, so important flows must be
  diagnosable after deployment

## Core Rules

- Instrument important business flows intentionally; do not rely only on
  framework defaults for domain-critical visibility.
- Prefer one structured logging format per environment rather than ad-hoc JSON
  logging in application code.
- Keep telemetry low-noise: every metric, span tag, and log field should help
  answer a production question.
- Do not emit sensitive tokens, raw credentials, or full PII into logs,
  metrics, or trace tags.
- Avoid double-instrumenting the same flow with overlapping timers or counters.

## Metrics And Trace Tags

- Use **low-cardinality** tags for dimensions that are safe to aggregate in
  metrics and traces:
  - operation name
  - bounded outcome values such as `success`, `failure`, `validation_error`
  - provider names when the set is bounded
- Use **high-cardinality** values only in traces or logs, not metrics:
  - user IDs
  - transaction IDs
  - email addresses
  - request IDs
  - free-form external references
- Treat metric-cardinality explosion as a production bug. If a value can grow
  unbounded, it does not belong as a metric tag.

## Logging Rules

- Prefer Spring Boot native structured logging formats when logs need to be
  machine-readable.
- Current Spring Boot formats include:
  - ECS
  - GELF
  - Logstash
- Structured logging is disabled by default and must be enabled explicitly per
  output target.
- Typical enablement looks like:
  - `logging.structured.format.console=ecs`
  - `logging.structured.format.file=logstash`
- Typical configuration lives under:
  - `logging.structured.format.console`
  - `logging.structured.format.file`
- ECS uses `spring.application.name` as the default `service.name` value.
- Use consistent field names and correlation IDs across logs and traces.
- Log business events at meaningful boundaries, not every internal helper call.
- Use warn/error logs for actionable operational failures, not expected
  validation outcomes that are already modeled in API responses.

## Business Metrics

Add business metrics when a flow is operationally important, such as:

- auth login success/failure split
- token refresh failures
- payout or transaction submission outcomes
- settlement success/failure counts
- provider callback failures

Prefer:

- counters for occurrence tracking
- timers for latency
- distribution summaries only when raw-size distributions matter

Before adding a metric, be able to answer:

1. What production question will this metric answer?
2. What action will the team take if it changes?

## Observation And Tracing Rules

- Prefer built-in Spring / Micrometer instrumentation first.
- Use `ObservationRegistry` when a business flow needs a traceable unit that is
  not already covered clearly enough by framework instrumentation.
- Spring Boot auto-configures `ObservationRegistry`; inject it directly and do
  not create a second registry manually.
- `@Observed` is the annotation-based alternative for creating observations.
  Do not use both `@Observed` and programmatic `ObservationRegistry`
  instrumentation on the same code path or you will create duplicate metrics
  and traces.
- `@Observed` requires observation annotations to be enabled and
  `org.aspectj:aspectjweaver`, typically via `spring-boot-starter-aspectj`.
- Name observations consistently and keep names stable.
- Add bounded, meaningful low-cardinality key-values for aggregation.
- Put per-request or per-entity identifiers into logs or high-cardinality trace
  fields only when genuinely needed for debugging.

## Async And Context Propagation

- **Servlet + `@Async`**:
  - register a `ContextPropagatingTaskDecorator` bean
  - class:
    `org.springframework.core.task.support.ContextPropagatingTaskDecorator`
  - apply it to the executor used for async work
  - do not assume Spring Boot auto-configures this for you
- **Reactive pipelines**:
  - use `spring.reactor.context-propagation=auto`
  - the task-decorator approach does not apply to reactive chains
- If a flow crosses threads and loses correlation data, treat that as an
  observability defect.

## Actuator Expectations

- Keep `/actuator/health` available for platform checks.
- Be intentional about which additional Actuator endpoints are exposed in each
  environment.
- Use Actuator as operational support, not as a substitute for domain metrics.

## Review Checklist

- Important flows expose enough logs, metrics, or traces to debug failures
- Metric tags are bounded and aggregation-safe
- High-cardinality values are not used as metric tags
- Structured logging format is consistent with the target environment
- No sensitive data is emitted into telemetry
- Async or background execution preserves context where required
- New operational behavior is reflected in config or docs when needed
