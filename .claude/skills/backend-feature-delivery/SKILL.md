# Backend Feature Delivery (TreasuryFlow)

Use this skill when a backend feature or endpoint change spans multiple layers
and you need the contract-first delivery flow for the Spring Boot backend.

This is a reference skill, not an executable command.

For direct Claude workflow execution, use:

- `/add-endpoint` for API endpoint work
- `/create-migration` for schema changes

## Delivery Order

1. Confirm the feature context from the wiki and the local backend docs.
2. Update the source contract first in `shared/api-contracts/openapi.yml`.
3. Regenerate clients so downstream surfaces stay aligned.
4. Implement backend DTOs, controller, service, and persistence changes.
5. Add or update a Flyway migration if the schema changes.
6. Re-check security, validation, errors, and tests before handoff.

## What To Touch

Depending on the scope, backend delivery may involve:

- `shared/api-contracts/openapi.yml`
- `backend/src/main/kotlin/.../modules/<domain>/controller/`
- `backend/src/main/kotlin/.../modules/<domain>/dto/`
- `backend/src/main/kotlin/.../modules/<domain>/service/`
- `backend/src/main/kotlin/.../modules/<domain>/repository/`
- `backend/src/main/kotlin/.../modules/<domain>/model/`
- `backend/src/main/resources/db/migration/`
- `backend/docs/entities/` when the domain model meaning changes

## Core Rules

- Keep the flow contract-first: OpenAPI before controller and DTO code.
- Controllers call services, never repositories directly.
- Entities never become the JSON boundary; API responses use DTOs.
- Schema changes use Flyway migrations and follow `migration-conventions`.
- Route exposure changes must be reflected in `SecurityConfig` and checked
  against `security-auth`.
- Business authorization changes must be checked against
  `authorization-rules`.
- Validation and error responses must align with the typed error model:
  `code`, `message`, and optional `details`.

## Cross-References

  controller/service patterns
- `@.claude/skills/security-auth/SKILL.md` for route exposure, JWT behavior,
  and current-user access
- `@.claude/skills/authorization-rules/SKILL.md` for method-level
  authorization, ownership checks, and service-level policy design
- `@.claude/skills/error-handling/SKILL.md` for API exceptions, error codes,
  and validation response conventions
- `@.claude/skills/jpa-kotlin-patterns/SKILL.md` for entity and repository
  modeling

  rules
- `@.claude/skills/testing-patterns/SKILL.md` for unit and integration test
  expectations

## Review Checklist

- Contract updated before implementation
- Generated clients refreshed where needed
- DTOs separated cleanly from entities
- Controller/service/repository layering preserved
- Public vs authenticated route behavior re-checked
- Ownership, visibility, or role-based access reviewed against
  `authorization-rules` if behavior affects who can act on a resource
- Validation and error payloads aligned with `docs/api/conventions.md`
- Schema changes migrated and documented when needed
