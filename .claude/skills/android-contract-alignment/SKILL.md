# Android Contract Alignment

Use this skill when backend-facing Android code changes.

## Role boundary

- Own request and response shapes, enums, Retrofit endpoints, and auth-related contract wiring.
- Defer screen structure, design-system reuse, and general repository workflow to companion skills.

## DTO and enum rules

- Keep DTOs in `feature/*/data/remote/dto/` when the payload is feature-specific.
- Keep shared DTOs in `core/model/` when multiple features consume the same shape.
- DTOs use `@Serializable` (Kotlinx Serialization) - do not use Gson or Moshi annotations.
- Domain models in `feature/*/domain/` are framework-light (no serialization annotations).
- Map DTOs to domain models in the repository layer, not in ViewModels.

## Retrofit and service rules

- Retrofit API interfaces live in `feature/*/data/remote/api/` or `core/network/`.
- API base URL comes from `ApiService` configuration in `core/network/`; do not hardcode URLs.
- Auth headers come from `AuthInterceptor` reading `TokenStorage`; do not add ad hoc token plumbing in features.
- Token refresh is handled by `TokenAuthenticator` (OkHttp Authenticator), and refresh failure falls back to `SessionManager.onLogout()`. Features do not handle 401s directly.

## Cross-check sources

- Use the OpenAPI spec in `shared/api-contracts/openapi.yml` as the primary source for endpoint shapes.
- Use the backend in `backend/` to confirm endpoint behavior when the spec is ambiguous.

## Validation

- Run `./gradlew compileDebugKotlin` (or `gradlew.bat` on Windows) after contract changes.
- Add targeted tests when mapper or repository logic changes.
