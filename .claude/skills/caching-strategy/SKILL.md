# Caching Strategy (TreasuryFlow Backend)

Use this skill when backend performance work introduces caching or when a review
needs to decide whether caching is appropriate at all.

## Role Boundary

- Use this skill for cache suitability, cache-aside patterns, TTL selection,
  invalidation, and local-versus-shared cache tradeoffs.
- Use `performance-and-query-shaping` first when the real problem may be query
  design rather than missing cache.
- Use `observability-and-telemetry` for cache hit/miss instrumentation.
- Use `security-auth` for token/session correctness; do not improvise auth
  caching rules here.

## Core Rule

Caching is optional performance infrastructure, not a correctness shortcut.

If the team cannot explain how stale data is tolerated or invalidated, the
backend is not ready to cache that path.

## Good Candidates For Caching

- bounded reference data
- rarely changing configuration or metadata
- expensive read models whose staleness window is acceptable
- provider metadata or discovery data with a clear refresh policy

## Dangerous Candidates For Caching

- mutable transactional state that drives approvals, settlements, or balances
- permission or ownership decisions unless staleness is explicitly acceptable
- write-after-read flows where stale values create business mistakes
- anything with no clear invalidation story

For finance operations work, treat caching of approval, settlement, and
money-adjacent state as high risk by default.

## Cache-Aside Pattern

Default to cache-aside when caching is appropriate:

1. read from cache
2. on miss, load from source
3. write result into cache
4. on mutation, invalidate or refresh deliberately

Do not let controllers or random helpers each implement their own ad hoc cache
logic.

## TTL Rules

- Pick TTLs based on business tolerance for staleness, not guesswork.
- Short TTLs reduce stale risk but may not justify cache complexity.
- Long TTLs are acceptable only when the underlying data truly changes slowly or
  invalidation is strong.
- Document why a TTL was chosen when the cached data matters operationally.

## Invalidation Rules

- Every cached mutable read path needs an invalidation story tied to writes.
- Prefer explicit invalidation on mutation over hoping the TTL expires soon
  enough.
- If invalidation cannot be made reliable, reconsider whether the data should be
  cached at all.

## Reference Data Vs Transactional Data

- **Reference data** is usually the safest cache target.
- **Transactional state** needs stronger scrutiny because stale reads can create
  incorrect business actions.
- If a piece of data participates directly in financial decisions, approvals, or
  reconciliation, assume correctness beats cache hit rate.

## Local Vs Shared Cache

### Local cache

Use when:

- the data is small and bounded
- per-instance duplication is acceptable
- cross-instance coherence is not critical

### Shared cache

Use when:

- the cache must be coherent across instances
- warm-up cost is high enough to justify shared infrastructure
- the operational team accepts the added complexity and failure modes

Do not introduce shared-cache infrastructure for a weak or unclear use case.

## Key Design Rules

- Keep keys explicit and stable.
- Do not build keys from free-form unbounded input when cardinality can explode.
- Include versioning or namespacing when cached representation changes are
  likely over time.

## Review Checklist

- Query or fetch-plan improvements were considered before caching
- The cached data is actually safe to serve stale
- TTL has a concrete business rationale
- Mutation paths invalidate or refresh cached reads intentionally
- Cache keys are bounded and understandable
- Local versus shared cache tradeoffs were chosen deliberately
- Money-adjacent or permission-critical state is not cached casually
