# Performance & Query Shaping (TreasuryFlow Backend)

Use this skill while authoring complex repository/query behavior and again while
reviewing backend work for fetch strategy, pagination, and data-access risk.

## Role Boundary

- Use this skill for query shaping, fetch strategy, projection choices,
  pagination, dynamic filtering, and performance review of repository-backed
  flows.
- Use `jpa-kotlin-patterns` for base entity and relationship modeling.
- Use `caching-strategy` when performance pressure suggests caching.
- Use `migration-conventions` when index changes are required.
- Use `observability-and-telemetry` when query behavior needs operational
  measurement.

## Core Rule

Prefer query behavior that is explicit, reviewable, and proportional to the
read/write use case.

The goal is not to use the fanciest JPA feature. The goal is to avoid hidden
N+1 behavior, over-fetching, unstable pagination, and repository code that
nobody can reason about later.

## When To Leave Derived Queries Behind

Derived repository methods are fine for:

- simple lookups by ID or unique fields
- small bounded predicates
- obvious ordering rules

Move to a more explicit strategy when you need:

- multiple optional filters
- fetch-plan control
- list/read models with partial field selection
- repeated query logic shared across multiple entry points
- a query whose behavior is no longer obvious from the method name

## N+1 Review Checklist

Before merging a repository-backed list or detail flow, ask:

- does this service touch lazy relationships inside a loop?
- does DTO mapping trigger extra lazy loads?
- does the controller serialize something that was not fetched intentionally?
- is a paginated list accidentally loading children for every row?

If the answer is yes, shape the fetch plan deliberately instead of hoping
Hibernate will be kind.

## Fetch Strategy Rules

### `@EntityGraph`

Use `@EntityGraph` when:

- the fetch plan is stable
- the query itself is otherwise simple
- you want declarative eager loading without rewriting the whole query

### `JOIN FETCH`

Use `JOIN FETCH` when:

- the association set is small and well-understood
- you need one explicit query with known eager associations
- the result is not a paginated collection that will explode row counts

Be careful with fetch joins on paginated to-many relationships; they often
create duplicate-row and page-boundary problems.

### Projections

Prefer projections when:

- a list or dashboard needs only a subset of fields
- you do not need a fully managed entity graph
- the response is read-oriented rather than mutation-oriented

For read-heavy list views, projections are often safer than loading a full
aggregate and then mapping it down.

## Pagination Rules

- Paginated endpoints should page on a stable sort order.
- Avoid pagination without a deterministic sort.
- Keep sort options bounded; do not expose arbitrary field names from the API
  without an explicit whitelist.
- For large datasets, prefer indexed filter and sort paths.
- Re-check whether a total count is actually needed on every read path.

## Sorting And Filtering Rules

- Keep public filter and sort parameters explicit and bounded.
- Do not let repository method names become a combinatorial explosion of filter
  permutations.
- When filter combinations grow, use composable query logic instead of adding
  one more giant derived query name.

## Specifications And Spring Data 4 APIs

- Use `JpaSpecificationExecutor<T>` when dynamic filtering needs composition.
- Prefer small reusable predicate builders over one monolithic specification.
- Spring Data 4 also supports `PredicateSpecification<T>` for lighter-weight,
  query-type-agnostic predicate composition where that reads more clearly.
- Use the fluent `findBy(...)` API from `JpaSpecificationExecutor` when the call
  site benefits from explicit `.page()`, `.first()`, `.count()`, or `.exists()`
  composition.

Keep specifications readable. If the team needs a whiteboard to understand one,
the abstraction has likely gone too far.

## Batch Fetching

- Use Hibernate batch fetching to reduce query chatter for repeated lazy loads
  when the association access pattern is known and bounded.
- Treat global batch size as a tuning tool, not a substitute for query design.
- Re-check memory impact when batch sizes grow.

## Index Expectations

- Foreign-key columns that drive common lookups usually need indexes.
- Repeated filter + sort paths usually need deliberate index support.
- If a query only becomes fast after loading the world and filtering in memory,
  the problem is the query design, not the JVM.

## Concurrency Cross-Reference

- Performance tuning must not break correctness.
- For contested aggregates, review `@Version` and optimistic-locking guidance in
  `jpa-kotlin-patterns`.
- Do not replace correctness with a faster-looking query that bypasses the
  concurrency model silently.

## Review Mode

- DTO mapping that hides lazy loads
- fetch joins on paginated to-many relationships
- missing indexes for new filter paths
- projections that should replace entity loading
- specifications that became harder to reason about than the query they replaced
- repository methods that embed authorization rules so deeply that the service
  layer no longer explains visibility policy

## Review Checklist

- Query shape matches the read/write use case
- N+1 risk was checked explicitly
- Fetch plan is intentional and understandable
- Pagination uses stable bounded sort behavior
- Dynamic filtering uses readable composition
- Index implications were considered for new lookup paths
- Query optimizations do not bypass concurrency or visibility semantics
