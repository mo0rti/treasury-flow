# Authorization Rules (TreasuryFlow Backend)

Use this skill when a backend change affects who is allowed to act on a
resource, view a record, or perform a business operation after authentication
has already succeeded.

## Role Boundary

- Use `security-auth` for:
  - filter chain configuration
  - public vs authenticated routes
  - JWT and token lifecycle behavior
  - auth bootstrap configuration
- Use this skill for:
  - method-level authorization
  - ownership checks
  - visibility rules
  - role vs policy distinctions inside business flows
- Use `error-handling` for the exception and error-code shape when access is
  denied.

## Current Template Reality

- The template does **not** enable method security by default.
- Route-level protection exists already through `SecurityConfig`.
- As the backend grows, request matchers alone are not enough; business access
  decisions belong closer to service methods and domain rules.

## Bootstrap Rule

When method-level authorization is required:

- enable `@EnableMethodSecurity`
- do **not** use `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity`; it is deprecated

Use method security only when it improves clarity. Do not scatter it
thoughtlessly across every method.

## Where Authorization Lives

- **Request matchers** answer:
  - is this route public or authenticated?
- **Method security** answers:
  - does this caller have the required role or policy to execute this action?
- **Imperative service checks** answer:
  - does this caller own or have visibility into this specific record?
  - does a multi-step business rule allow this transition right now?

Do not force all authorization into annotations if the rule depends on loaded
entity state, cross-record evaluation, or nuanced domain transitions.

## Preferred Patterns

### 1. Broad gate with method security

Use `@PreAuthorize` for broad policy gates that must block execution before the
method runs, such as:

- admin-only actions
- finance-admin settlement operations
- manager-only approval actions
- role-gated maintenance endpoints

Use `@PostAuthorize` only for read operations where the returned result must be
validated after retrieval.

- Do **not** use `@PostAuthorize` on methods that write to the database.
- The method executes before the check runs, so a denied `@PostAuthorize`
  cannot safely prevent a committed write.
- Treat `@PostAuthorize` as a read-result validation tool, not a write-safety
  mechanism.

### 2. Fine-grained rule in the service

Use service-level imperative checks for:

- resource ownership
- visibility rules
- tenant/account scoping
- state-dependent transitions
- combinations of role + resource state + actor relationship

### 3. Keep controllers thin

- Controllers should not grow custom permission trees.
- Controllers may pass the current authenticated principal or actor context into
  services, but business authorization should stay in service-level policy code.

## Ownership And Visibility Rules

- Prefer explicit methods such as:
  - `requireCanViewResource(actor, resource)`
  - `requireCanApproveAction(actor, target)`
  - `requireCanTransitionState(actor, aggregate)`
- Keep ownership and visibility rules readable and centralized.
- Do not spread the same access rule across controller, repository, and service
  layers in slightly different forms.

## Role Checks Vs Policy Checks

- Use role checks when the permission is truly static and organization-wide.
- Use policy checks when access depends on the actor, the resource, and its
  current state.
- Prefer naming by action and business meaning over raw role-only naming.

Example:

- weaker: `isAdmin(user)`
- stronger: `canSettleTransaction(actor, transaction)`

## Repository And Query Boundaries

- Repositories should not become ad-hoc permission engines.
- Query-level scoping is useful, but do not hide all authorization in
  repository method names alone.
- If the database query must pre-filter visible records, keep the policy rule
  understandable at the service layer as well.

## Testing Expectations

- Test both allowed and denied paths.
- Test owner vs non-owner behavior explicitly.
- Test role overrides intentionally.
- Test state-sensitive authorization transitions, not just happy-path access.

## Review Checklist

- Route authentication and business authorization are not conflated
- `@EnableMethodSecurity` is enabled only when the code actually uses it
- Deprecated `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity` is not introduced
- `@PostAuthorize` is not used on write methods
- Controllers stay thin and avoid permission sprawl
- Ownership and visibility checks live in readable service-level policy code
- Access-denied outcomes map cleanly into the backend error model
