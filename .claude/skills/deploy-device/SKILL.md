# Deploy Device

Build the requested variant, install it with `adb`, and launch it.

## Request

$ARGUMENTS

## Inputs

- Variant: `debug` (default)
- Optional adb serial when multiple devices are connected

## Workflow

1. Resolve variant from `$0` (default `debug`).
2. List devices with `adb devices -l`.
3. Stop if there is no authorized device or emulator.
4. Build the variant:
   - `./gradlew assembleDebug` (or `gradlew.bat` on Windows)
5. Use the matching APK path:
   - `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
6. Use the package id: `com.mortitech.treasuryflow`
7. Install with `adb install -r`.
8. Launch with `adb shell monkey -p com.mortitech.treasuryflow -c android.intent.category.LAUNCHER 1`.

## Notes

- If multiple devices or emulators are connected and no serial is provided, ask which target to use before install and launch.
- Add `-s <serial>` to adb commands when a target device is specified.
