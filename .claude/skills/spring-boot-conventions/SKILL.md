# Spring Boot Conventions (TreasuryFlow Backend)

This project uses **Spring Boot 4.0.x** with **Kotlin 2.2+** and **Java 21**. It follows a package-based modular structure under `com.mortitech.treasuryflow.modules.<domain>`.

## Module Structure

Each domain module lives under `modules/<domain>/` with subpackages:

```
modules/<domain>/
  controller/    # REST controllers
  dto/           # Request/response data classes
  model/         # Entities, enums, value objects
  repository/    # JPA repositories
  service/       # Business logic, orchestration
```

Not every module needs all subpackages - small modules may only have `controller/` + `service/`.

### Layer Dependencies (strict)

- `controller` depends on `service` only (never directly on `repository` or `model` entities)
- `service` depends on `model` and `repository`
- `model` has NO web, DTO, or framework dependencies
- Controllers never call repositories directly

## Controller Conventions

```kotlin
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/v1/<domain>")
@Tag(name = "<Domain>")  // Swagger grouping
class SomethingController(private val someService: SomeService) {

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    @Operation(summary = "Get something by ID")
    fun getById(@PathVariable id: UUID): ResponseEntity<SomeDto> { ... }
}
```

- All endpoints live under `/api/v1/`
- Return `ResponseEntity<T>` from all controller methods
- Use `@Operation(summary = ...)` for Swagger docs on every endpoint
- Use `@Tag(name = ...)` at the class level for Swagger grouping
- Path variables use `UUID` type for entity IDs

## Service Conventions

```kotlin
@Service
class SomeService(
    private val someRepository: SomeRepository,
    private val otherService: OtherService
) {
    @Transactional
    fun createSomething(request: CreateSomethingRequest): SomeDto { ... }

    @Transactional(readOnly = true)
    fun getById(id: UUID): SomeDto { ... }
}
```

- Use `@Transactional` on write methods, `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` on read methods
- Keep database transactions narrow; do NOT hold them open across outbound HTTP, OAuth, or other network calls
- Services are the only layer that converts between entities and DTOs
- Throw exceptions for error cases - `GlobalExceptionHandler` converts them to HTTP responses
- Never call `@Transactional` methods from the same class (proxy bypass)
- Do NOT rely on `@Transactional` on private methods; Spring proxy-based transaction management will not intercept them

## DTO Conventions

Two mapping patterns are used:

### 1. Extension functions (default for pure mappings)

```kotlin
// In a dedicated mapper file
fun SomeEntity.toDto() = SomeDto(
    id = this.id,
    name = this.name
)

fun CreateSomethingRequest.toEntity() = SomeEntity(name = this.name)
```

### 2. @Component mapper classes (only when mapping needs dependencies)

```kotlin
@Component
class SomeMapper(private val otherService: OtherService) {
    fun toDto(entity: SomeEntity): SomeDto { ... }
}
```

- DTOs are data classes in the `dto/` package
- Keep each DTO class in its own Kotlin file so type ownership, reuse, navigation, and refactoring remain predictable as modules grow
- Entities are NEVER serialized directly to JSON - always map to DTOs
- Request DTOs are separate from response DTOs when shapes differ
- Use summary DTOs for list views, full DTOs for detail views (don't over-fetch)
- Default to manual mapping functions for pure entity/DTO transformations
- Keep mapper logic pure: no repository access, permission checks, state transitions, or other business rules
- Use Spring-managed mapper classes only when mapping genuinely needs injected collaborators
- Preserve domain enums in response DTOs when the API contract owns those enums; avoid flattening them to raw strings without a concrete contract reason

## Internal Models

- Put reusable non-entity domain value objects and normalized integration models in `model/` unless a dedicated subpackage makes the boundary clearer
- Do NOT use `service/` as a catch-all for helper data classes
- Prefer explicit names such as `*Profile`, `*Details`, or `*State` so internal models are not confused with API DTOs or entities

## Configuration Conventions

- Prefer typed `@ConfigurationProperties` classes for medium-to-large backend configuration
- Group config classes under a package such as `bootstrap/properties`
- Inject typed config objects into services and bootstrap components rather than scattering repeated property keys with `@Value`
- Reserve `@Value` for small one-off wiring cases only

## File Organization Conventions

- Keep each entity, enum, DTO, and reusable value object in its own Kotlin file
- Do NOT group multiple DTO classes into a single `*Dtos.kt` file
- Do NOT keep reusable enums inside an entity file; place them in dedicated files under `model/`

## Repository Conventions

See the `jpa-kotlin-patterns` skill for full repository, entity, and transaction patterns.

Repository interfaces live in the `repository/` package within each module.

## Forbidden Patterns

- `entity -> DTO` imports (entities never depend on API DTOs)
- `controller -> repository` imports (controllers call services, never repositories directly)
- `runBlocking` in MVC controllers
- Jackson annotations on JPA `@Entity` classes (use DTOs as the serialization boundary)
