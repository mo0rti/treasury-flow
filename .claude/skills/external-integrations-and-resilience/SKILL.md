# External Integrations & Resilience (TreasuryFlow Backend)

Use this skill when backend work calls external systems or depends on provider
callbacks, webhooks, or other non-local boundaries.

## Role Boundary

- Use this skill for outbound client design, timeout and retry policy,
  idempotency, remote error translation, and transaction boundaries around
  remote calls.
- Use `spring-boot-conventions` for controller and service structure.
- Use `security-auth` for OAuth login mechanics and route exposure.
- Use `error-handling` for API-facing exception and error-code shape.
- Use `observability-and-telemetry` for logging, metrics, traces, and
  correlation around remote flows.

## Current Platform Reality

- The generated backend already makes outbound OAuth calls through dedicated
  Spring beans rather than through controllers.
- The same separation should hold for future banking, payout, ledger, or vendor
  integrations.
- The exact HTTP client can vary over time; the resilience rules in this skill
  apply regardless of whether the implementation uses `RestTemplate`,
  `RestClient`, `WebClient`, or a provider SDK.

## Client Boundary Rules

- Keep remote protocol details behind a dedicated collaborator such as:
  - `FooProviderClient`
  - `FooGateway`
  - `FooIntegrationService`
- Controllers never call external systems directly.
- Keep request signing, auth headers, provider DTOs, and status-code handling
  out of business services when a dedicated client boundary would keep the code
  clearer.
- Normalize remote payloads into explicit internal models before business logic
  consumes them.

## Timeout Rules

- Every outbound call must have explicit timeout behavior.
- Do not rely on library defaults or infinite waits.
- Configure connect and read/response timeouts through typed backend config,
  not scattered literals.
- Use shorter timeouts for interactive request paths than for deliberate
  back-office batch or reconciliation work.
- If a remote dependency is optional for the current request, fail fast and
  degrade intentionally instead of blocking a request thread indefinitely.

## Retry Rules

- Retry only for transient failures such as:
  - connection resets
  - timeouts
  - bounded `5xx` responses when the provider contract allows it
- Do not blindly retry:
  - validation failures
  - auth failures
  - semantic conflicts
  - duplicate-submission responses that are already business answers
- Keep retries bounded.
- Add backoff and jitter when repeated attempts are possible.
- Prefer retries only on idempotent operations or on operations that include an
  idempotency key and a provider contract that supports safe replay.

## Idempotency Rules

- For create, submit, payout, or settlement-style remote operations, define the
  idempotency story before writing the happy path.
- Prefer one of these patterns:
  - provider-supported idempotency key
  - stable business operation key stored locally
  - durable external-reference mapping that lets the backend detect replay
- Treat duplicate side effects as a correctness bug, not just an availability
  issue.
- If a provider callback can arrive more than once, make callback handling
  replay-safe.

## Error Translation Rules

- Translate remote failures into explicit backend exceptions or result types.
- Do not leak raw provider SDK exceptions, low-level HTTP exceptions, or remote
  payload shapes into controllers.
- Separate these cases clearly:
  - remote unavailable / timeout
  - remote rejected request
  - remote auth misconfiguration
  - duplicate or already-processed request
  - malformed or unexpected provider response
- Keep provider wording out of public API messages unless product requirements
  explicitly want that language surfaced.

## Transaction Boundary Rules

- Do not hold a database transaction open across outbound HTTP calls.
- For request-response flows:
  1. prepare local state
  2. perform remote call outside a long-lived DB transaction
  3. persist the resulting state transition inside a narrower transaction
- If the workflow needs durable handoff between local state and later remote
  completion, prefer an asynchronous pattern such as a queued follow-up or
  outbox-style design instead of a single oversized transaction.
- Treat network calls inside `@Transactional` write methods as a code smell that
  requires an explicit reason.

## Remote Model And Mapping Rules

- Keep provider DTOs or raw JSON models local to the integration boundary.
- Map them into normalized internal models before business services use them.
- Do not reuse external payload DTOs as API response DTOs.
- Keep provider enum drift isolated at the boundary so domain code does not
  become a mirror of a vendor API.

## Testing Expectations

- Unit-test business services with a mocked integration boundary.
- Use `MockRestServiceServer`, a mock web server, or equivalent HTTP doubles for
  the integration client itself.
- Test retry behavior, timeout mapping, and duplicate callback handling
  deliberately.
- Keep representative provider payload samples near the tests so parsing and
  translation drift is visible in review.
- For critical financial flows, test both the success path and the "remote call
  succeeded but local persistence follow-up failed" path.

## Review Checklist

- Remote protocol details stay out of controllers
- Outbound calls have explicit timeout behavior
- Retries are bounded and only applied where replay is safe
- Idempotency is defined for side-effecting remote operations
- Remote failures are translated into backend-owned exceptions or result types
- Database transactions are not held open across network calls
- Integration tests cover timeout, rejection, and replay/duplicate scenarios
