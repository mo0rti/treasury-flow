# Security & Authentication (TreasuryFlow Backend)

Apply this skill when a backend change affects route exposure, JWT handling, or auth behavior.

## Role Boundary

- Use this skill for public/private route decisions, JWT flow, auth configuration, and current-user access.
- Use `authorization-rules` for method-level authorization, ownership checks, and business-policy access decisions inside authenticated flows.
- Use `spring-boot-conventions` for general controller and service structure.
- Use `error-handling` for auth-related exception codes and API error responses.

## Current Security Model

- Stateless JWT: `SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS`
- Password auth uses `BCryptPasswordEncoder`
- Password inputs are bounded to BCrypt's 72-byte effective limit
- `JwtAuthenticationFilter` runs before `UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter`
- CORS allowed origins come from `app.cors.allowed-origins`
- Route access is controlled in `bootstrap/SecurityConfig.kt`
- Method-security annotations are not enabled by default in this template
- When business authorization grows beyond route exposure, enable and model it intentionally through `authorization-rules` rather than widening route rules alone
- Refresh tokens carry a version claim and are rotated on every successful login, OAuth callback, and refresh
- Local email/password registration does not include a full email-verification workflow by default
- Auth endpoints are not rate-limited by a distributed/shared store in this scaffold

## Public Endpoints

Defined explicitly in `SecurityConfig.securityFilterChain()`:

- `/api/v1/auth/oauth/callback`

- `/api/v1/auth/register`
- `/api/v1/auth/login`
- `/api/v1/auth/refresh`
- `/actuator/health`
- `/swagger-ui.html`, `/swagger-ui/**`, `/v3/api-docs/**` only when SpringDoc is explicitly enabled

## Authenticated Endpoints

- `/api/v1/auth/me`
- `/api/v1/auth/logout`
- Every other backend route that is not explicitly permitted

## Current User Access

In controllers, use `@AuthenticationPrincipal`:

```kotlin
@GetMapping("/me")
fun getProfile(@AuthenticationPrincipal user: User): ResponseEntity<UserDto> {
    return ResponseEntity.ok(user.toDto())
}
```

Use `SecurityContextHolder` only when controller-level injection is not practical.

## Rules

- Keep public matchers explicit; never widen them to `/api/v1/auth/**`.
- Update `SecurityConfig` whenever endpoint exposure changes.
- Use `@AuthenticationPrincipal` in controllers when possible.
- Keep secrets in environment-backed config, never hardcoded Kotlin values.
- Align backend route security with `shared/api-contracts/openapi.yml`.
- Access and refresh tokens must carry an explicit token-type claim, and each usage path must validate the expected type before accepting the token.
- Rotate refresh tokens on every successful refresh and reject reused refresh tokens.
- Do not silently link an OAuth sign-in to an existing account that shares only an email address; require an explicit account-linking flow instead.

## Auth-Specific Modeling

- Follow `spring-boot-conventions` for DTO splitting, mapper placement, enum files, and general module layout
- Keep normalized OAuth provider data as an internal model such as `OAuthUserProfile`, not as an API DTO and not as a helper class buried in `service`
- Keep provider-specific HTTP exchange and payload normalization out of controllers

## Security Configuration

- Bind JWT, CORS, and OAuth provider settings with typed `@ConfigurationProperties`
- Group auth-related config under `bootstrap/properties`
- When adding a provider, update config properties, OAuth flow handling, and public route exposure together
- Do not wrap outbound OAuth HTTP calls in long-lived database transactions; fetch remote provider data first, then persist within a narrower transaction boundary if needed

- For first startup after generation, a local profile may provide placeholder OAuth values so the backend can boot before real provider credentials are configured
- The local profile may also provide a bootstrap-only JWT secret so first startup works without exporting `JWT_SECRET`
- Treat placeholder OAuth values as a bootstrap convenience only; real OAuth flows still require real credentials supplied through IDE environment variables or local overrides

- Remove global fallback secrets from shared config and require environment-backed secrets outside the local/test profiles

## Key Files

- `bootstrap/SecurityConfig.kt` - filter chain, route exposure rules, CORS

- `bootstrap/OAuth2Config.kt` - infrastructure beans for OAuth support

- `bootstrap/security/JwtTokenProvider.kt` - token generation and validation
- `bootstrap/properties/OAuthProperties.kt` - OAuth provider configuration
- `bootstrap/properties/JwtProperties.kt` - JWT configuration
- `bootstrap/properties/CorsProperties.kt` - CORS configuration
- `bootstrap/security/JwtAuthenticationFilter.kt` - request filter that validates JWT
- `application.yml` - JWT secret, token expiry, OAuth client IDs

## Minimum Checks

- Re-check unauthenticated access to any route whose matcher changed.
- Re-check intended public auth endpoints after auth-surface changes.
- Verify that `/api/v1/auth/refresh` accepts only refresh tokens and that protected routes reject refresh tokens as bearer credentials.
- Verify that refresh-token reuse fails after a successful refresh or logout.
- Update the OpenAPI contract if endpoint security changed.
