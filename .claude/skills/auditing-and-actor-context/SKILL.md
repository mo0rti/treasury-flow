# Auditing & Actor Context (TreasuryFlow Backend)

Use this skill when backend work changes how the system records who acted, when
they acted, or what history must remain reviewable later.

## Role Boundary

- Use this skill for timestamp ownership, actor attribution, audit-trail design,
  and the boundary between entity auditing and business-event history.
- Use `jpa-kotlin-patterns` for entity modeling basics.
- Use `migration-conventions` when audit fields or audit tables require schema
  changes.
- Use `authorization-rules` when actor context affects who may perform an
  operation.
- Use `observability-and-telemetry` for logs, metrics, and traces; telemetry is
  not a substitute for durable audit data.

## Current Template Reality

- The generated backend currently uses `AuditableEntity` with constructor-backed
  `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields plus `@PreUpdate`.
- `@EnableJpaAuditing` is not enabled by default.
- `@CreatedBy`, `@LastModifiedBy`, and `AuditorAware` are not scaffolded by
  default.

This means the current baseline already covers **entity timestamps**, but it
does not automatically provide **actor attribution** or a **durable business
audit trail**.

## Three Different Audit Layers

Keep these layers distinct:

1. **Entity timestamps**
   - `createdAt`
   - `updatedAt`
   - useful for operational recency and ordering
2. **Actor attribution**
   - who created or last changed a record
   - useful when ownership or review history matters
3. **Domain audit trail**
   - what business action happened
   - who triggered it
   - from which prior state to which new state
   - why it happened when reason capture is required

Do not expect one field pair on an entity to satisfy all three concerns.

## Current Baseline Rules

- Keep normal entities on the shared `AuditableEntity` base unless the entity has
  a concrete reason not to.
- Treat `createdAt` / `updatedAt` as technical metadata, not as a full domain
  history.
- If a business flow needs to know the acting user right now, pass explicit
  actor context into the service method rather than relying on hidden static
  lookups everywhere.
- Prefer durable actor IDs or stable internal identities over display names or
  email addresses when persisting actor references.

## When Entity Timestamps Are Enough

The current `AuditableEntity` baseline is usually enough for:

- CRUD-oriented records where "when was this last changed?" is sufficient
- low-risk reference data maintenance
- operational ordering and stale-data detection

Do not over-engineer actor attribution on every table if the product and audit
requirements do not actually need it.

## When To Add Actor Attribution

Reach for actor attribution when:

- multiple authenticated users change the same records
- compliance or reviewer expectations require knowing who changed something
- staff actions must be distinguishable from system-initiated actions
- admin overrides or approvals need a clear trail

Typical patterns:

- explicit `createdByUserId` / `updatedByUserId` fields when only a few
  aggregates need it
- Spring Data auditing with `@CreatedBy` / `@LastModifiedBy` and
  `AuditorAware` when the pattern needs to be broad and consistent

## Upgrade Path To Spring Data Auditing

If the backend needs broad actor attribution, migrate intentionally rather than
mixing patterns ad hoc.

The upgrade path is:

- enable `@EnableJpaAuditing`
- add `AuditingEntityListener`
- replace timestamp ownership in the entity base with `@CreatedDate` and
  `@LastModifiedDate`
- add an `AuditorAware` implementation that resolves the current actor context
- decide how background jobs, reconciliation flows, and migration scripts
  identify system actors

Do not partially adopt Spring Data auditing on a few entities while leaving the
rest of the model semantically unclear.

## System Actors Vs Human Actors

- Define how non-human actions are represented.
- Typical options:
  - a dedicated system user identity
  - a bounded actor type enum plus actor reference
  - a structured audit entry that distinguishes `USER`, `SYSTEM`, and
    `INTEGRATION`
- Keep background jobs, webhook processors, and administrative scripts from
  being falsely attributed to the last interactive user.

## Domain Audit Trail Rules

Entity timestamps are not enough when the product needs to answer questions
like:

- who approved this payout?
- who changed this settlement status?
- what was the previous value?
- was this action manual, scheduled, or provider-driven?

For those cases:

- create an explicit audit/history model
- store the action name and meaningful state transition
- store actor context
- store the event time
- store any durable external reference required for review

Keep domain audit records append-only unless a concrete compliance policy says
otherwise.

## Migration And Schema Considerations

- Add audit columns or audit tables through Flyway migrations.
- Backfill actor fields only when the source of truth for old records is
  trustworthy enough to justify it.
- If historical actor information is unknown, prefer an explicit sentinel such
  as `system-migrated` or a nullable historical field with a documented meaning
  over made-up precision.

## Testing Expectations

- Test timestamp behavior only where custom behavior exists; do not write noisy
  tests for framework defaults alone.
- Test actor attribution for both authenticated and system-driven flows.
- Test approval or state-transition audit entries as domain behavior, not as a
  side note.
- If `AuditorAware` is introduced, test how it behaves with missing or
  unexpected security context.

## Review Checklist

- Entity timestamps, actor attribution, and domain history are not conflated
- The current `AuditableEntity` baseline is used intentionally where sufficient
- Actor IDs are stable and product-meaningful
- Background or system actions are not misattributed to human users
- Domain-critical actions use explicit audit/history records when needed
- Any migration to Spring Data auditing is done coherently rather than partially
