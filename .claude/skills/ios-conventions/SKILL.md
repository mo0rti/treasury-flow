# iOS Conventions

Apply these rules whenever you change iOS app code in this repository.

## Role boundary

- Use this skill for repository-wide guardrails that apply across features.
- Keep feature sequencing in `ios-feature-delivery`, backend-facing contract details in `ios-contract-alignment`, shared SwiftUI guidance in `swiftui-design-system`, and task selection in `ios-build-verify`.

## Core rules

- Follow MVVM with the generated structure under `treasuryflow/`.
- All API calls go through `APIClient`; do not create raw `URLSession` calls in features.
- Repositories have protocols and implementations in the same file under `Data/Repository/`.
- ViewModels that drive SwiftUI state are `@MainActor @Observable` by default, and views use `@Bindable` when they need mutation access.
- Use `async/await` for async operations.
- Because UI-driving ViewModels are `@MainActor`, their methods already run on the main actor by default. Reach for `MainActor.run` only when non-isolated code needs to publish back into a main-actor-owned ViewModel or UI state.
- Prefer `Sendable` value types for DTOs, domain models, and helper structs that cross actor boundaries.
- Use `TokenStorage` for auth and session state; do not bypass it for token access.
- `DependencyContainer` is injected with SwiftUI environment at the app root. Screens usually receive feature ViewModels through initializers, not environment objects.
- Keep long-lived `@Observable` instances out of frequently recomputed `body` code paths. Parent views or router-level owners should create them once and pass them down.
- `@Observable` redraws only the views that read the changed property. Do not assume every property mutation invalidates the entire screen.
- Do not introduce `@unchecked Sendable` or `nonisolated` workarounds in app code unless the reason is explicit and documented in the change.
- Keep routes in `Navigation/Route.swift` and top-level auth gating in `Navigation/AppRouter.swift`.
- Preserve stable accessibility identifiers on screen roots and critical controls that generated UI tests depend on.
- Move reusable SwiftUI components into `UI/Common/` and shared styling primitives into `UI/Theme/`.
- Regenerate the Xcode project after structural `project.yml` changes such as new targets, schemes, Swift Packages, xcconfig wiring, build settings, entitlements, resource bundles, capabilities, or deployment-target changes.

## Reference files

Read only the reference file the task needs:

- `references/swift6-observation-and-di.md` for `@MainActor`, Observation, `@Bindable`, environment injection, and ViewModel ownership rules
- `references/navigation.md` for route ownership, `AppRouter`, `NavigationStack`, sheet usage, and iPad-only multi-column guidance
- `references/swiftdata-patterns.md` for `ModelContext` actor confinement, query ownership, and schema-evolution basics

## Read these docs only when needed

- `mobile-ios/docs/repo-orientation.md`
- `mobile-ios/docs/architecture.md`
- `mobile-ios/docs/file-structure.md`
- `mobile-ios/docs/networking-and-auth.md`
- `mobile-ios/docs/session-and-token-storage.md`
- `mobile-ios/docs/navigation-and-screens.md`
- `mobile-ios/docs/design-system-and-theme.md`
- `mobile-ios/docs/naming-conventions.md`
- `mobile-ios/docs/conventions-and-workflow.md`

## Minimum verification

- Run `task mobile-ios:build` on Mac after architecture-sensitive changes.
- If you are not on Mac, explicitly report which iOS verification steps were skipped, why they were skipped, and that real validation is deferred to Mac CI or a Mac follow-up session.
