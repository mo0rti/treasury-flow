description: Cross-layer feature orchestration for the generated iOS app. Use when a task spans multiple layers and needs scoped planning, companion-skill selection, validation, and documentation updates across models, networking, repositories, ViewModels, SwiftUI screens, navigation, and docs.

# iOS Feature Delivery

Use this skill to coordinate non-trivial feature work that crosses layers.
Invoke it explicitly with `/ios-feature-delivery <feature-description>` when you want the full feature workflow applied.

## Role boundary

- Use this skill as the delivery checklist and orchestration layer for multi-step work.
- Pull in companion skills for detailed rules instead of restating repository, contract, UI, or verification conventions here.

## Request

$ARGUMENTS

## 1. Research the current shape

- Inspect the surrounding code under `treasuryflow/Data/`, `DI/`, `Navigation/`, and `UI/`.
- Read only the docs needed for the task, starting with `mobile-ios/docs/repo-orientation.md`, `mobile-ios/docs/conventions-and-workflow.md`, and `mobile-ios/docs/architecture.md`.
- Reuse nearby patterns before inventing a new one.

## 2. Verify contracts and parity

- Cross-check `shared/api-contracts/openapi.yml` when endpoints, DTOs, or enums are involved.
- Cross-check `backend/` when behavior or response semantics need confirmation.
- Cross-check `mobile-android/` when product parity or UX intent matters.


## 3. Map affected layers

Cover only the layers the feature truly needs:

- Domain models
- API endpoints and network transport
- Repository protocol plus implementation
- ViewModel state and intent methods
- SwiftUI screens and shared UI
- Navigation routes and auth gating
- Dependency wiring in `DependencyContainer`
- Documentation updates in `mobile-ios/docs/`

## 4. Load the right companion skills

- Use `ios-conventions` for repository-wide Swift, SwiftUI, MVVM, navigation, and doc-sync rules.
- Use `ios-contract-alignment` for endpoint, DTO, `APIClient`, and auth-boundary decisions.
- Use `swiftui-design-system` for shared UI language, reusable components, and visual consistency.
- Use `ios-testing` for XCTest baselines, Swift Testing guidance, and choosing between unit and UI coverage.
- Use `ios-build-verify` to choose the smallest trustworthy validation.

## 5. Execute and close out

- Implement only the layers the feature actually touches.
- If ViewModel or repository logic is added or changed, add at least one targeted test and confirm it passes with `task mobile-ios:test-unit` on Mac before close-out. Escalate to `task mobile-ios:test` when the change also affects app flow or UI behavior.
- If UI or navigation behavior is added or changed, confirm accessibility labels, traits, touch targets, and stable identifiers are still correct before close-out.
- If shared UI in `UI/Common/` is added or changed, include `#Preview` coverage that applies the shared theme tokens where applicable.
- If storage, file access, user defaults, or a new third-party SDK is introduced, review privacy manifest guidance and update `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` when the project starts using covered APIs.
- If `project.yml` structure may be affected, rerun `task mobile-ios:generate-project` before close-out.
- If actors, `@Observable` ViewModels, or async/await boundaries are touched, confirm no `@unchecked Sendable` or `nonisolated` workarounds were introduced without explicit justification.
- Run at least `task mobile-ios:build` on Mac, plus stronger targeted verification when the change crosses logic or integration boundaries.
- Update any affected docs in the same session.
