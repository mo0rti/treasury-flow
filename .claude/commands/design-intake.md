## Notes for the agent

- If a board review exists for this feature, check whether the design addresses the
  board's concerns. If a board concern is unaddressed by the design, flag it as an
  open question with owner = `designer`.
- Figma links cannot be read directly. Note the URL and proceed with written descriptions.
