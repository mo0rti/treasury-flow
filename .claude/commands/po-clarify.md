# PO clarify — answer open questions assigned to PO

## Usage
/po-clarify

## What this command does

1. Read `knowledge/wiki/SCHEMA.md`
2. Read all files in `knowledge/wiki/features/`
3. Collect all open questions where owner = `po` and status = `open`
4. Group by feature and present them to the user one feature at a time:
   ```
   F-002 — Profile Edit
   1. What happens when a user tries to edit their email but email is used for login?
   2. Should users be able to delete their account from this screen?
   ```
5. For each question the user answers:
   - Update the open questions table: change status to `resolved: [answer]`
   - If the answer reveals a new requirement, update the feature spec
   - If the answer contradicts an existing wiki entry, flag and quarantine
6. Update `index.md` if any feature's owner or status changes
7. Append a single log entry summarizing all questions resolved

## Notes for the agent

- Present questions one feature at a time. Do not dump all questions at once.
- After each answer, confirm what you updated before moving to the next.
- If the user's answer introduces a new open question, add it immediately.
- Questions tagged "[Board: ...]" came from a board review. Treat them with the same
  priority as other open questions.
