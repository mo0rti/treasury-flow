Add a new external integration to TreasuryFlow.

Ask me for the integration details if I have not provided them clearly:

- provider or system name
- direction (`outbound client`, `callback/webhook`, or both)
- auth style
- key operations or endpoints
- failure or retry expectations

## Steps

1. **Confirm the product scope**
   - Read the relevant wiki feature and backend requirements.
   - Clarify whether this is a synchronous request-path dependency, an async
     callback flow, or both.

2. **Define the backend boundary**
   - Choose the owning module and where the integration client or gateway lives.
   - Keep remote protocol details out of controllers.

3. **Add typed configuration**
   - Add or update `@ConfigurationProperties` for provider URLs, credentials,
     timeout settings, and any feature flags.
   - Keep secrets environment-backed, never hardcoded.

4. **Implement the integration boundary**
   - Add the client, gateway, or provider service.
   - Normalize provider payloads into internal models before business logic uses
     them.
   - Translate remote errors into backend-owned exceptions or result types.

5. **Set resilience rules**
   - Define explicit timeout behavior.
   - Add bounded retry behavior only where replay is safe.
   - Define idempotency for side-effecting outbound operations or replayable
     callbacks.
   - Do not hold long-lived database transactions open across outbound calls.

6. **Wire observability**
   - Add only the logs, metrics, and traces needed to diagnose provider
     failures, retries, and callback outcomes.

7. **Test the boundary**
   - Add unit tests for business behavior.
   - Add integration-boundary tests with a mock server or
     `MockRestServiceServer`.
   - Cover timeout, rejection, duplicate/replay, and malformed-response paths.

8. **Verify downstream impact**
   - Update OpenAPI and generated clients if public API behavior changed.
   - Update docs when the integration meaning or operational expectations
     changed.
