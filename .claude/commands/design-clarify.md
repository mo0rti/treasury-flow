# Design clarify — answer open questions assigned to Designer

## Usage
/design-clarify

## What this command does

Identical in structure to /po-clarify but filters for open questions where owner = `designer`.

1. Read `knowledge/wiki/SCHEMA.md`
2. Read all files in `knowledge/wiki/features/`
3. Collect all open questions where owner = `designer` and status = `open`
4. Present questions grouped by feature, one feature at a time
5. For each answer:
   - Update the open questions table in the feature file
   - If the answer reveals a missing design artifact, note it in the design page
   - If the answer resolves a design state gap, update the design page's "States covered" section
6. Update `index.md` if any feature status changes
7. Append to `log.md` with a summary of questions resolved

## Notes for the agent

- Present questions one feature at a time.
- After each answer, confirm what you updated before moving to the next.
- Questions tagged "[Board: ...]" came from a board review. Flag them clearly and treat
  with high priority — they represent domain expert concerns the designer must address.
