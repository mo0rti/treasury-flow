Add a new API endpoint to TreasuryFlow.

Ask me for the endpoint details if I haven't provided them: HTTP method, path, description, request/response shape.

## Steps

1. **Update OpenAPI Spec** - Add the new path, parameters, request body, and response schemas to `shared/api-contracts/openapi.yml`. Follow conventions in `docs/api/conventions.md`:
   - Use camelCase for JSON fields
   - Use plural nouns for resource paths
   - Include pagination for list endpoints (page, size, totalElements, totalPages)
   - Use standard error format: `{ code: string, message: string, details?: object }`

2. **Regenerate Clients** - Run `task generate-clients`.

3. **Implement Backend** - Add the endpoint in `backend/`:
   - Controller method with proper annotations
   - Service method with business logic
   - Repository method if data access is needed
   - DTOs for request/response
   - Add Flyway migration if schema changes are needed and follow `@.claude/skills/migration-conventions/SKILL.md`

4. **Verify** - Run `task backend:test` to ensure nothing is broken.

## Conventions

- GET for reads, POST for creates, PUT for full updates, PATCH for partial, DELETE for removal
- Return 201 for creates, 200 for updates/reads, 204 for deletes
- All list endpoints support pagination
- Auth endpoints are public; all others require Bearer token
- Keep the flow OpenAPI-first, then generated clients, then backend implementation
