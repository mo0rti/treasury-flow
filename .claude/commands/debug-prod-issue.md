Debug a backend production issue in TreasuryFlow.

Ask me for the incident details if I have not provided them clearly:

- failing feature or endpoint
- user-visible symptom
- first-known time window
- whether logs, metrics, traces, or request IDs are available

## Steps

1. **Frame the incident**
   - Identify the failing capability, expected behavior, and observed failure.
   - Pin the likely modules, routes, jobs, or integrations involved.

2. **Check recent change surface**
   - Review recent contract, config, migration, security, or integration changes
     near the failure.

3. **Inspect telemetry**
   - Use logs, metrics, and traces to identify where the failure starts.
   - Look for timeout patterns, retries, auth failures, validation spikes, and
     callback anomalies.

4. **Check data and migration state**
   - Review whether schema drift, bad backfill data, or index changes could
     explain the issue.

5. **Check auth and authorization paths**
   - Re-check route exposure, token type, current-user resolution, and business
     authorization if the symptom could be permission-related.

6. **Check external dependencies**
   - Re-check provider health, timeout behavior, remote payload drift, retry
     storms, and idempotency assumptions if an integration is involved.

7. **Produce a hypothesis set**
   - List the most likely causes in priority order.
   - For each one, note the next confirming check or the safest fix direction.

8. **Close with operational guidance**
   - Separate immediate mitigation from root-cause fix and from follow-up hardening.
