# Prep sprint — show what is ready to build

## Usage
/prep-sprint

## What this command does

1. Read `knowledge/wiki/WIKI_REPORT.md` first if it exists for a quick orientation summary
2. If `knowledge/wiki/WIKI_REPORT.md` is absent, tell the user to run `/feature-status`
   first so the orientation report exists on demand
3. Read `knowledge/wiki/SCHEMA.md`
4. Read `knowledge/wiki/index.md`
5. Read all feature files with status = `ready-for-dev` or `in-dev`
6. For each feature, read its platform-requirements pages
7. Output a structured report:

   ```
   ## Ready to build

   ### F-002 — Profile Edit [ready-for-dev]
   Platforms: mobile-android, mobile-ios, backend
   Design: knowledge/wiki/design/F-002-profile-edit.md
   Board review: done
   Requirements:
   - Android: knowledge/wiki/platform-requirements/F-002-mobile-android.md
   - iOS: knowledge/wiki/platform-requirements/F-002-mobile-ios.md
   - Backend: knowledge/wiki/platform-requirements/F-002-backend.md
   Open dev questions: none
   Dependencies: none

   ## Blocked (has dev-owned open questions)
   - F-006 — Search: "Is full-text search feasible with current DB? [dev, open]"

   ## Board review pending (not ready for dev)
   - F-007 — Nutrition Score [specified, advisory-review: pending]

   ## Not ready (in earlier lifecycle stages)
   - F-003 — Admin dashboard [in-design, owner: designer]
   ```

8. Do not modify any wiki files. Read-only command.

## Notes for the agent

- `WIKI_REPORT.md` is an orientation artifact, not the source of truth; use the underlying
  feature and requirement pages for actual delivery decisions.
- Features with `advisory-review: pending` must not appear in the "Ready to build"
  section. List them separately under "Board review pending."
- Dependencies must be checked and stated explicitly.
- If any ready-for-dev feature has no platform-requirements pages, flag it as incomplete.
