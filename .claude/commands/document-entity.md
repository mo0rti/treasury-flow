Document a data entity for TreasuryFlow.

Ask me for the entity name and its fields if I haven't provided them.

## Steps

1. **Create Entity Doc** - Create `backend/docs/entities/{entity-name}.md` using the template at `backend/docs/entities/_template.md`. Fill in:
   - Entity name and description
   - All fields with types, constraints, and defaults
   - Relationships to other entities
   - Validation rules and business logic
   - Database indexes

2. **Update Architecture Doc** - If this is a new entity, add it to the entity list in `docs/architecture.md`.

3. **Review Existing Features** - Check `knowledge/wiki/features/` for any feature wiki pages that reference this entity and update them if needed.

## Template Reference

See `backend/docs/entities/_template.md` for the expected format. Key sections:
- **Fields**: name, type, nullable, default, constraints
- **Relationships**: foreign keys, one-to-many, many-to-many
- **Indexes**: performance-critical queries
- **Business Rules**: validation, computed fields, lifecycle hooks
