Review the backend security surface in TreasuryFlow.

Ask me for the target if I have not provided it clearly:

- PR diff, file, feature, or module
- whether the review should focus on route exposure, JWT/auth behavior,
  authorization policy, or the full backend surface

## Review Focus

1. **Route exposure**
   - Re-check public vs authenticated routes in `SecurityConfig`.
   - Flag widened matchers or unintentionally public paths.

2. **Token behavior**
   - Check token-type validation, refresh-token rotation, and protected-route
     handling.
   - Verify refresh tokens are not accepted as bearer access tokens.

3. **Current-user access**
   - Prefer `@AuthenticationPrincipal` where practical.
   - Flag hidden security-context usage when it makes behavior harder to reason
     about.

4. **Authorization boundary**
   - Distinguish route authentication from business authorization.
   - Review ownership, visibility, and role/policy checks against
     `authorization-rules`.

5. **Integration and secret handling**
   - Check auth-related provider config, environment-backed secrets, and remote
     auth boundary design.

6. **Verification**
   - Check whether tests cover the changed exposure or authorization paths.

## Output

Provide:

- prioritized findings first
- route/auth versus business-policy separation notes
- concrete files or rules that need follow-up
- missing test or verification gaps
