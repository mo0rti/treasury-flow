# Dev done — mark a feature as shipped

## Usage
/dev-done [F-XXX]

## What this command does

1. Read `knowledge/wiki/features/[F-XXX]-[slug].md`
2. Show the user what will change and ask:
   "Any deviations from the spec to record? Any board review concerns that turned out
   differently in implementation than expected? Any lessons learned?"
3. If the user provides notes, append a `## Post-ship notes` section to the feature file
4. Update feature file: status → `done`, owner → `none`
5. Update all platform-requirements pages: status → `done`
6. Update api-contracts page if it exists: status → `implemented`
7. Update `index.md` status board
8. Append to `log.md`

## Notes for the agent

- If a board review was done for this feature, ask specifically: "Did any of the board's
  concerns materialize? Were any concerns unfounded? This helps calibrate future reviews."
- Deviations from spec are valuable wiki content. If the developer built something
  different from what was specified, that difference belongs in post-ship notes.
