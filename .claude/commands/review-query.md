Review backend query behavior in TreasuryFlow for performance and fetch-shaping risk.

Ask me for the target if I have not provided it clearly:

- PR diff, file, repository, or feature
- whether this is a read-path review, write-path review, or both

## Review Focus

1. **Query shape**
   - Is the repository method still understandable?
   - Should a derived query become a projection, explicit query, or
     specification?

2. **Fetch plan**
   - Check for N+1 risk in service mapping or iteration.
   - Review `@EntityGraph`, join fetches, projections, and lazy-load behavior.

3. **Pagination and sorting**
   - Verify stable bounded sort rules.
   - Flag paginated fetch joins that are likely to duplicate rows or break page
     semantics.

4. **Filtering strategy**
   - Review dynamic filtering for readability and bounded API behavior.
   - Check whether `JpaSpecificationExecutor`, `PredicateSpecification`, or a
     simpler explicit query is the better fit.

5. **Index implications**
   - Flag new filter or sort paths that likely need index support.

6. **Correctness guardrails**
   - Check that performance shortcuts do not bypass visibility rules,
     transactional expectations, or optimistic-locking needs.

## Output

Provide:

- prioritized findings first
- why each issue matters
- suggested fix direction
- any missing verification or test coverage
