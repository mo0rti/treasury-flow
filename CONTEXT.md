# TreasuryFlow - Product context

This file is the master context anchor for all AI agents working in this repository.
Read this before working in any platform directory.

## Project identity

**Name:** TreasuryFlow
**Description:** A finance operations platform for payout approvals, settlements, and transaction oversight

## First-time setup

If this is a newly scaffolded project, run the setup command before anything else.
It initializes the wiki, interviews you about your domain, and generates the advisory
board configuration. It takes 15-20 minutes and runs once.

- **Claude Code:** `/setup-project`
- **Codex:** `$setup-project`
- **Cursor:** ask the agent: "run setup-project" - it will follow the steps in
  `knowledge/wiki/SCHEMA.md` and `.claude/commands/setup-project.md`

This generated repository includes the platform slices selected during generation.
Read the root agent file first, then defer to the platform-local guidance inside the folders that are present.

## The product wiki

All product knowledge lives in `knowledge/wiki/`. Before implementing any feature:

1. Read `knowledge/wiki/index.md` - confirm the feature is in `ready-for-dev` or `in-dev`
   status and that `advisory-review` is not `pending`. If `advisory-review` is `pending`,
   stop and inform the human - a board review should happen before implementation.
2. Read `knowledge/wiki/features/[feature-id]-[slug].md` for full context
3. Read `knowledge/wiki/platform-requirements/[feature-id]-[THIS_PLATFORM].md` for your
   specific implementation requirements
4. Read `knowledge/wiki/api-contracts/[feature-id].md` if this feature has an API surface
5. Check `knowledge/wiki/business-rules/` for rules that apply to this feature
6. Check `knowledge/wiki/advisory/BOARD.md` to understand the domain intelligence layer

The wiki is the single source of truth. If a feature has no wiki page, do not implement
it. Ask the human to run the `po-intake` operation first
(Claude: `/po-intake [folder]`, Codex: `$po-intake [folder]`,
Cursor: ask the agent to "run po-intake on [folder]").
