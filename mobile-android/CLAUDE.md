# Android - TreasuryFlow

Kotlin + Jetpack Compose with MVVM, Hilt, Retrofit, Room, and DataStore.

## Product knowledge wiki

This project uses a shared product wiki at `knowledge/wiki/` as the single source of
truth for what to build. Before implementing any feature:

1. Read `knowledge/wiki/index.md` - confirm the feature is in `ready-for-dev` or `in-dev`
   status and that `advisory-review` is not `pending`. If `advisory-review` is `pending`,
   stop and inform the human. A board review should happen before implementation.
2. Read `knowledge/wiki/features/[feature-id]-[slug].md` for full context
3. Read `knowledge/wiki/platform-requirements/[feature-id]-mobile-android.md` for
   Android-specific implementation requirements
4. Read `knowledge/wiki/api-contracts/[feature-id].md` if this feature has an API surface
5. Check `knowledge/wiki/business-rules/` for rules that apply to this feature
6. Read `knowledge/wiki/design/[feature-id]-[slug].md` for UI design decisions

**Do not implement features without a wiki page.** Ask the human to run the `po-intake`
operation first (Claude: `/po-intake [folder]`, Codex: `$po-intake [folder]`,
Cursor: ask the agent to "run po-intake on [folder]").

If you discover information during implementation that should update the wiki, propose
the update and ask for confirmation before writing, or route a question using the `ask`
command (Claude: `/ask F-XXX "..." --to po`, Codex: `$ask F-XXX "..." --to po`).

## Documentation

**Full project documentation** is in **`docs/`**. Use it as the reference for architecture, file structure, build, networking, navigation, design system, and workflows.

| Doc | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) | MVVM, layers, DTO-first, repositories, session, navigation. |
| [docs/file-structure.md](docs/file-structure.md) | Package layout: `feature/`, `core/`, `designsystem/`, `navigation/`. |
| [docs/build-and-environments.md](docs/build-and-environments.md) | Build commands, SDK versions, troubleshooting. |
| [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md) | Compile, unit, instrumentation layers, emulator workflow, CI verification. |

## Workspace Root

This `mobile-android/` folder is a platform slice inside the generated project, not the
generated project root.

For Claude Code work, prefer opening the **generated repository root** so root context files
and project skills are available together with the Android code.

From `mobile-android/`, the generated repository root is:

- `../`

Important root-level files and folders from here:

- `../README.md` - generated project overview
- `../CONTEXT.md` - root AI context anchor
- `../CLAUDE.md` - root Claude guidance for the generated repo
- `../.claude/skills/` - project Claude skills shared across the generated repo

If you open only `mobile-android/` as a standalone workspace, do not assume Claude Code can
automatically discover skills or root context from the parent repository. In that setup,
manually check the parent generated-project root when it is available.

```

**Min SDK**: 29 | **Target SDK**: 36 | **Compile SDK**: 36

## Architecture (summary)

MVVM in a single `:app` module. See **docs/architecture.md** for full detail.

- **Feature code:** `feature/<name>/data/` (API, DTOs, repository), `feature/<name>/domain/` (models), `feature/<name>/ui/` (screens, ViewModels).
- **Shared UI/theme:** `designsystem/` (theme, components, text).
- **Cross-cutting:** `core/` (network, database, session, DI, model).
- **Repositories:** Concrete classes only in `feature/*/data/repository/`; no repository interfaces.
- **Navigation:** Routes in `navigation/Screen.kt`, host in `navigation/NavGraph.kt`.

## Key Conventions

- MVVM: `StateFlow` for UI state, `SharedFlow` for one-off events, explicit `onXxx(...)` ViewModel methods.
- Hilt for DI; Retrofit in `core/di/NetworkModule.kt`; use `SessionManager` for auth state and `AppResult` for fallible repository work.
- Strings in `strings.xml`; use `stringResource` or `UiText`.
- Keep navigation in `Screen.kt` and `NavGraph.kt`.
- Keep reusable Compose components in `designsystem/` instead of feature-local files.
- DTOs (`@Serializable`) in `feature/*/data/remote/dto/`; domain models are framework-light.
- `AppResult<T>` instead of `kotlin.Result` to avoid naming collision.
- ViewModels map repository errors into `UiText` before exposing them.
- Dispatchers: Use `@IoDispatcher`, `@DefaultDispatcher`, `@MainDispatcher` qualifiers from DispatcherModule.
- Tests: MockK + Turbine for unit tests, Compose UI tests under `app/src/androidTest/`, and Hilt Android testing for instrumentation when DI overrides are needed.
- Emulator baseline: API 36 phone for normal UI verification; add API 29 phone when changes touch auth, insets, storage, or device behavior.

## Keep documentation in sync

When you change code in this project, **update the relevant documentation in the same session** so docs stay accurate:

- If you add, remove, or rename **packages, modules, or key files** -> update **docs/file-structure.md** (and any doc that lists them).
- If you change **architecture, patterns, or layer roles** -> update **docs/architecture.md**.
- If you change **build commands or environments** -> update **docs/build-and-environments.md**.
- If you add/change **APIs, DI modules, or networking** -> update **docs/networking-and-di.md**.
- If you add/change **routes or screens** -> update **docs/navigation-and-screens.md**.
- If you change **theme, design system, or components** -> update **docs/design-system-and-theme.md**.
- If you change **conventions or the new-feature workflow** -> update **docs/conventions-and-workflow.md**.

Documentation style rule:
- Documentation must describe the current state only.
- Avoid historical phrasing like "was", "used to", "now", "previously".
- Write implementation notes in present tense as source-of-truth behavior.

## Workflow: Implementing a New Feature

1. Check **docs/conventions-and-workflow.md** and existing patterns in `feature/`, `designsystem/`, `core/`.
2. Verify API/data contract with the OpenAPI spec in `shared/api-contracts/openapi.yml`.
3. Plan DTO/API/repository/ViewModel/screen/navigation/DI changes.
4. Implement using existing MVVM and conventions.
5. Validate with `./gradlew compileDebugKotlin`, targeted tests, `./gradlew lintDebug` when resources or manifests change, and `./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest` on an emulator when UI behavior changes.
6. **Update any affected docs** (see "Keep documentation in sync" above).

## Local Claude Skills

Project-specific Claude skills live in **`.claude/skills/`** and follow the current Claude Code project-skill layout.
In this generated project, that path is relative to the **generated repository root**, not
inside `mobile-android/`. From this folder, the expected location is:

- `../.claude/skills/`

Keep skill boundaries orthogonal: `android-conventions` is the baseline ruleset, `android-feature-delivery` is the coordinator for cross-layer work, and the remaining skills own specialist domains.
Use `/android-feature-delivery <feature-description>` when you want the full research, planning, validation, and documentation workflow for a larger feature request.

- @.claude/skills/android-contract-alignment/SKILL.md - own backend-facing DTO, enum, Retrofit, and service-alignment decisions
- @.claude/skills/android-testing/SKILL.md - own unit-test, Compose UI test, and Hilt-aware instrumentation patterns
- @.claude/skills/compose-design-system/SKILL.md - own shared Compose UI language, reusable components, and screen-pattern reuse
- @.claude/skills/deploy-device/SKILL.md - build, install, and launch on a connected Android device
