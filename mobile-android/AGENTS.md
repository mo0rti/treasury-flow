# Android - TreasuryFlow

Kotlin + Jetpack Compose with MVVM, Hilt, Retrofit, Room, and DataStore.

## Product knowledge wiki

This project uses a shared product wiki at `knowledge/wiki/` as the single source of
truth for what to build. Before implementing any feature:

1. Read `knowledge/wiki/index.md` - confirm the feature is in `ready-for-dev` or `in-dev`
   status and that `advisory-review` is not `pending`. If `advisory-review` is `pending`,
   stop and inform the human. A board review should happen before implementation.
2. Read `knowledge/wiki/features/[feature-id]-[slug].md` for full context
3. Read `knowledge/wiki/platform-requirements/[feature-id]-mobile-android.md` for
   Android-specific implementation requirements
4. Read `knowledge/wiki/api-contracts/[feature-id].md` if this feature has an API surface
5. Check `knowledge/wiki/business-rules/` for rules that apply to this feature
6. Read `knowledge/wiki/design/[feature-id]-[slug].md` for UI design decisions

**Do not implement features without a wiki page.** Ask the human to run the `po-intake`
operation first (Claude: `/po-intake [folder]`, Codex: `$po-intake [folder]`,
Cursor: ask the agent to "run po-intake on [folder]").

If you discover information during implementation that should update the wiki, propose
the update and ask for confirmation before writing, or route a question using the `ask`
command (Claude: `/ask F-XXX "..." --to po`, Codex: `$ask F-XXX "..." --to po`).

## Documentation

Full project documentation is in `docs/`. Use it as the reference for architecture, file structure, build, networking, navigation, design system, and workflows.

- `docs/architecture.md` - MVVM, layers, DTO-first, repositories, session, navigation
- `docs/file-structure.md` - Package layout: `feature/`, `core/`, `designsystem/`, `navigation/`
- `docs/build-and-environments.md` - Build commands, SDK versions, troubleshooting
- `docs/testing.md` - compile/unit/instrumentation layers, emulator workflow, CI verification
- `docs/networking-and-di.md` - Retrofit, OkHttp, auth, Hilt modules
- `docs/navigation-and-screens.md` - Routes (Screen.kt), NavGraph, auth gate, screen mapping
- `docs/design-system-and-theme.md` - AppTheme, colors, typography, design system components, UiText
- `docs/conventions-and-workflow.md` - Strings, dispatchers, SessionManager, new-feature workflow

## Workspace Root

This `mobile-android/` folder is a platform slice inside the generated project, not the
generated project root.

For Codex work, prefer opening the **generated repository root** so root context files and
project skills are available together with the Android code.

From `mobile-android/`, the generated repository root is:

- `../`

Important root-level files and folders from here:

- `../README.md` - generated project overview
- `../CONTEXT.md` - root AI context anchor
- `../AGENTS.md` - root Codex guidance for the generated repo
- `../.agents/skills/` - project Codex skills shared across the generated repo

If you open only `mobile-android/` as a standalone workspace, do not assume Codex can
automatically discover skills or root context from the parent repository. In that setup,
manually check the parent generated-project root when it is available.

## Build & Run

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug          # Build APK (or gradlew.bat on Windows)
./gradlew compileDebugKotlin     # Fast compile check
./gradlew compileDebugAndroidTestKotlin  # Compile instrumentation / Compose UI tests
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest      # Unit tests
./gradlew lintDebug              # Android lint checks
./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest  # Instrumentation / Compose UI tests
./gradlew assembleRelease        # Release APK / shrinker validation
./gradlew installDebug           # Install on device
adb devices                      # List connected devices/emulators
```

Min SDK: 29 | Target SDK: 36 | Compile SDK: 36

## Architecture

MVVM in a single `:app` module.

- Feature code: `feature/<name>/data/` (API, DTOs, repository), `feature/<name>/domain/` (models), `feature/<name>/ui/` (screens, ViewModels)
- Shared UI/theme: `designsystem/` (theme, components, text)
- Cross-cutting: `core/` (network, database, session, DI, model)
- Repositories: Concrete classes only in `feature/*/data/repository/`; no repository interfaces
- Navigation: Routes in `navigation/Screen.kt`, host in `navigation/NavGraph.kt`

## Key Conventions

- MVVM: `StateFlow` for UI state, `SharedFlow` for one-off events, explicit `onXxx(...)` ViewModel methods
- Hilt for DI; Retrofit in `core/di/NetworkModule.kt`; use `SessionManager` for auth state and `AppResult` for fallible repository work
- Strings in `strings.xml`; use `stringResource` or `UiText`
- Keep navigation in `Screen.kt` and `NavGraph.kt`
- Keep reusable Compose components in `designsystem/` instead of feature-local files
- DTOs (`@Serializable`) in `feature/*/data/remote/dto/`; domain models are framework-light
- `AppResult<T>` instead of `kotlin.Result`
- ViewModels map repository errors into `UiText` before exposing them
- Dispatchers: Use `@IoDispatcher`, `@DefaultDispatcher`, `@MainDispatcher` qualifiers
- Tests: MockK + Turbine for unit tests, Compose UI tests under `app/src/androidTest/`, and Hilt Android testing for instrumentation when DI overrides are needed
- Emulator baseline: API 36 phone for standard UI verification; add API 29 phone when changes touch auth, insets, storage, or device behavior

## Doc-Sync Rule

When you change code, update the relevant documentation in `docs/` in the same session.

## Workflow: New Feature

1. Check `docs/conventions-and-workflow.md` and existing patterns
2. Verify API contract in `shared/api-contracts/openapi.yml`
3. Plan DTO/API/repository/ViewModel/screen/navigation changes
4. Implement using MVVM conventions
5. Validate with `./gradlew compileDebugKotlin`, targeted tests, `./gradlew lintDebug` when resources or manifests change, and `./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest` on an emulator when UI behavior changes
6. Update affected docs

## Local Codex Skills

Project-specific Codex skills live in `.agents/skills/`.

In this generated project, that path is relative to the **generated repository root**, not
inside `mobile-android/`. From this folder, the expected location is:

- `../.agents/skills/`

- `$android-conventions` - repository-wide Android MVVM, DI, navigation, strings, and doc-sync guardrails
- `$android-build-verify` - pick the smallest trustworthy Gradle validation for Android changes
- `$android-contract-alignment` - own DTO, Retrofit, enum, mapper, and auth-boundary contract decisions
- `$android-feature-delivery` - coordinate larger feature work across docs, contracts, and platform code
- `$android-testing` - own unit-test, Compose UI test, and Hilt-aware instrumentation patterns
- `$compose-design-system` - own shared Compose UI language, reusable components, and screen-pattern reuse
