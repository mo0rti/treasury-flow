# Backend Entities

Use this directory to understand the persisted backend domain model.

## Entity Docs

- [User](user.md) - identity, auth provider, roles, and refresh-token session versioning
- [Transaction](transaction.md) - transaction lifecycle, visibility rules, and ownership checks

## Notes

- `_template.md` is the maintainer authoring template for adding future entity docs
- entity docs should stay aligned with JPA models, migrations, DTO exposure, and OpenAPI
