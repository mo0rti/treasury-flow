# Entity: User

## Description
Represents a registered user in the system. Users can always register with email and password, and may also be provisioned through Google, Apple OAuth, then authenticate with JWT-backed sessions.

## Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| id | UUID | Yes | Primary key |
| email | String | Yes | Email address (unique) |
| displayName | String | Yes | User's display name |
| avatarUrl | String | No | Profile picture URL |
| authProvider | Enum | Yes | Provider recorded for the account (`LOCAL`, `GOOGLE`, `APPLE`, with additional enum placeholders reserved in code) |
| providerId | String | No | Provider-specific subject/identity value for OAuth users |
| passwordHash | String | No | BCrypt hash (only for password auth) |
| role | Enum | Yes | User role: USER, ADMIN |
| refreshTokenVersion | Integer | Yes | Session version counter used to rotate and invalidate refresh tokens |
| createdAt | DateTime | Yes | Account creation timestamp |
| updatedAt | DateTime | Yes | Last update timestamp |

## Relationships

- **has many** [Transaction](transaction.md) records through `transactions.created_by`

## Validation Rules

- `email`: must be valid email format, unique across all users
- `displayName`: 1-100 characters
- `authProvider`: defaults to `LOCAL` for password-based accounts
- `passwordHash`: required for locally registered users and absent for pure OAuth users
- `role`: defaults to USER, can only be changed by admins

## Business Logic

- Users are created on first successful authentication
- OAuth login is rejected when the email already belongs to an existing account created through another sign-in method
- Locally registered users authenticate with email/password and receive JWTs
- Every successful login or refresh rotates the user's refresh-token version so older refresh tokens cannot be reused
- The generated backend always enables local password auth and also supports Google, Apple OAuth callback exchange

## Database

- **Table name**: `users`
- **Indexes**: unique on `email`, index on `auth_provider`
- **Migrations**: `V1__users.sql`

## API Exposure

- `refreshTokenVersion`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt` are persisted internal fields on the entity
- `UserResponse` intentionally exposes only identity, profile, provider, and role fields
- Do not add internal auth/session fields or audit timestamps to the public user DTO unless the API contract is updated first
