# iOS Design System And Theme - TreasuryFlow

## Shared Theme Primitives

`UI/Theme/AppTheme.swift` currently defines:

- semantic colors such as `appPrimary`, `appSurface`, `appError`, and dark-theme variants
- spacing constants in `Spacing`
- corner radius constants in `CornerRadius`
- a `Color(hex:)` helper for token translation

## Theme Safety Rules

- Shared `Color.app...` tokens should remain safe in both light and dark appearance.
- If a token is not clearly authored as a semantic light-and-dark-safe color, prefer system semantic roles like `.primary`, `.secondary`, and `.background`.
- Keep custom theme tokens aligned with the design tokens source and verify that dark mode remains readable after theme edits.

## Shared UI

Reusable UI currently lives in:

- `UI/Common/LoadingView.swift`
- `UI/Common/ErrorView.swift`
- `UI/Common/PrimaryButton.swift`

## Reuse Rules

- Prefer `Spacing` and `CornerRadius` constants over repeating raw values.
- Prefer shared theme colors over redefining colors in feature views.
- Promote reusable SwiftUI pieces into `UI/Common/` instead of copying them into feature folders.
- Keep feature views focused on composition and screen-specific behavior.
- Default to `ContentUnavailableView` for empty states on iOS 17 unless the feature needs a clearly differentiated branded alternative.
- Shared components in `UI/Common/` should include `#Preview` coverage using the shared theme tokens where applicable.
- Non-obvious actions should expose explicit accessibility labels, and custom tappable surfaces should keep button semantics and readable Dynamic Type behavior.
