# iOS Architecture - TreasuryFlow

The generated iOS slice follows MVVM with a small, explicit layering model.

## Layer Map

- `DI/` - `DependencyContainer` creates and owns shared services and repositories
- `Navigation/` - `AppRouter` controls the top-level auth gate and `Route` defines destinations
- `Data/Network/` - `APIClient` actor and `APIEndpoint` describe HTTP access
- `Data/Repository/` - repository protocols plus implementations bridge networking and screens
- `Data/Storage/` - `TokenStorage` stores auth tokens in Keychain and `CachedExample` stores local example data
- `Domain/Model/` - API-aligned models and request or response shapes
- `UI/` - SwiftUI screens, ViewModels, shared common views, and theme primitives

## State And Flow

- `AppRouter` checks `TokenStorage.hasToken()` to decide whether the app starts in login or example-list flow.
- `DependencyContainer` is injected at the app root through SwiftUI environment.
- App-level routing reads shared dependencies from that environment and passes feature ViewModels into screens through initializers.
- Screen ViewModels are `@MainActor @Observable` by default.
- SwiftUI screens consume ViewModels through `@Bindable`.
- `@Observable` invalidates only the views that read a changed property, not every consumer of the ViewModel.
- Repositories call `APIClient`.
- `APIClient` adds auth headers when an endpoint requires auth.

## Architectural Boundaries

- Views do not call `APIClient` directly.
- Repositories own transport-facing logic.
- `TokenStorage` is the only Keychain boundary.
- UI-driving state stays on the main actor.
- Route definitions stay in `Navigation/Route.swift`.
- Shared UI belongs in `UI/Common/` or `UI/Theme/`, not duplicated across feature folders.
