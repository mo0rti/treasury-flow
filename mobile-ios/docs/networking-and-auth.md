# iOS Networking And Auth - TreasuryFlow

## Networking Stack

- `APIEndpoint` defines path, method, and auth requirement.
- `APIClient` is an actor that performs JSON requests with `URLSession`.
- `APIClient.request<T>` decodes JSON responses.
- `APIClient.requestVoid` handles successful empty responses.
- `APIError` maps common transport and HTTP failure cases.

## Contract Source Of Truth

- [shared/api-contracts/openapi.yml](../../shared/api-contracts/openapi.yml) is the primary reference for endpoint paths, payloads, enums, and auth behavior.
- `backend/` is the secondary reference when the spec needs implementation clarification.


## Auth Flow

- `TokenStorage` stores access and refresh tokens in Keychain.
- `APIClient` reads the access token from `TokenStorage` and adds the `Authorization` header when an endpoint requires auth.
- `AuthRepository` owns login, refresh, current-user, and logout flows.
- Enabled auth methods in this generated project:
  - Email and password
  - Google OAuth
  - Apple Sign-In


## Current Behavior

- The base URL already includes `/api/v1`.
- Endpoint paths in `APIEndpoint` append to that base URL and therefore start with feature-relative paths like `/auth/...` or `/examples/...`.
- The default baseline for `APIError.unauthorized` is to clear stored tokens and return the app to login flow.
- That return-to-login transition should be driven by the app-level auth gate in `AppRouter`, not by ad hoc per-screen navigation logic.
- `AuthRepository.refreshToken()` exists as an extension point, but `APIClient` does not perform automatic refresh-and-retry orchestration by default.
- If a project later adds refresh-and-retry, keep that behavior centralized at the transport boundary instead of scattering retry logic across features.
- A correct refresh implementation must coordinate concurrent 401 responses so only one refresh is in flight at a time and peer requests await that result instead of starting their own refresh attempts.
- Client error flow should stay consistent: `APIClient` maps transport and HTTP failures, repositories translate only when needed, ViewModels map errors into view state, and views render shared loading or error patterns.

## Privacy Manifest Reminder

- The minimal scaffold does not include `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` yet.
- If the app starts using covered required-reason APIs, persistent storage patterns such as `UserDefaults`, file-system access, or third-party SDKs with privacy declarations, add or update the privacy manifest as part of the same change.
