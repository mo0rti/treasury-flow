# iOS Navigation And Screens - TreasuryFlow

## Routing

- `Navigation/Route.swift` defines the app routes:
  - `login`
  - `exampleList`
  - `exampleDetail(id:)`
- `Navigation/AppRouter.swift` is the top-level auth gate.
- Authenticated navigation uses `NavigationStack`.
- Route ownership stays in `Navigation/Route.swift`; feature screens should not invent their own global router abstraction.
- Unauthorized auth-state transitions should flow back through `AppRouter`, not through per-screen redirect logic.
- Use sheets for contained flows that should not deepen the primary authenticated stack.
- Use `NavigationSplitView` only when a feature clearly benefits from iPad or regular-width multi-column navigation.

## Current Screen Inventory

- `UI/Auth/LoginView.swift`
- `UI/Examples/ExampleListView.swift`
- `UI/Common/ErrorView.swift`
- `UI/Common/LoadingView.swift`
- `UI/Common/PrimaryButton.swift`

## Test Coverage

- `treasuryflowUITests/AppFlowUITests.swift` provides generated UI smoke coverage for auth-gate launch and logout behavior.

## Screen Rules

- Each screen owns a dedicated ViewModel.
- ViewModels are `@MainActor @Observable` by default.
- Views consume ViewModels through `@Bindable`.
- App-level owners inject shared dependencies through SwiftUI environment, then create and pass feature ViewModels through screen initializers.
- Route additions should update both `Route.swift` and the router or any calling navigation code.
- Keep stable accessibility identifiers on top-level screens and critical controls that generated XCUITests depend on.
- `examples.screen` anchors at the authenticated root, not the list content, so it can exist before example data finishes loading.
