# iOS Conventions And Workflow - TreasuryFlow

## Daily Conventions

- Use SwiftUI for UI.
- Use `@MainActor @Observable` ViewModels and `@Bindable` where views need mutation access.
- Use `async/await` for asynchronous work.
- Keep UI-driving state on the main actor.
- Inject `DependencyContainer` at the app root through SwiftUI environment, then pass feature ViewModels into screens through initializers.
- Remember that `@Observable` redraws only the views that read the changed property.
- Keep repository protocols and implementations together in `Data/Repository/`.
- Repository protocols and implementations injected into `@MainActor` ViewModels should be `Sendable`.
- Route all HTTP access through `APIClient`.
- Route all token persistence through `TokenStorage`.
- Preserve stable accessibility identifiers on screen roots and primary controls when editing UI covered by XCUITests.
- Treat `APIError.unauthorized` as a clear-tokens-and-return-to-login baseline unless the project intentionally adds centralized refresh-and-retry behavior.
- Avoid `@unchecked Sendable` and `nonisolated` workarounds unless the reason is explicit and documented.
- Update the relevant docs in the same session when behavior or structure changes.
- Regenerate the Xcode project after structural `project.yml` changes such as new targets, schemes, Swift Packages, xcconfig wiring, entitlements, resource bundles, capabilities, or deployment-target changes.

## Feature Workflow

1. Read [repo-orientation.md](repo-orientation.md) if you need a quick map.
2. Inspect the closest existing feature and the relevant docs.
3. Verify endpoint shapes in [shared/api-contracts/openapi.yml](../../shared/api-contracts/openapi.yml).
4. Cross-check `backend/` when the contract needs behavioral clarification.
5. Cross-check `mobile-android/` when parity matters.
6. Update only the layers the task needs.
7. Add the smallest useful test when ViewModel or repository logic changes, and prefer `task mobile-ios:test-unit` when UI is unaffected.
8. Run the smallest sufficient iOS build or test task on Mac.
9. Update affected docs before closing the task.
