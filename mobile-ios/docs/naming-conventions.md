# iOS Naming Conventions - TreasuryFlow

## Files And Types

- Views use `FeatureNameView.swift`
- ViewModels use `FeatureNameViewModel.swift`
- Repository files keep protocol plus implementation in the same file, for example `AuthRepository.swift`
- Models use API-aligned, singular type names where possible
- Route cases use lowerCamelCase

## Directories

- Keep network code in `Data/Network/`
- Keep repositories in `Data/Repository/`
- Keep persistence in `Data/Storage/`
- Keep shared presentation pieces in `UI/Common/` or `UI/Theme/`

## Tests

- Test files should mirror the source type they validate, for example `LoginViewModelTests.swift`
