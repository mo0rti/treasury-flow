# iOS Session And Token Storage - TreasuryFlow

## Token Storage

- `TokenStorage` is an actor.
- It stores `access_token` and `refresh_token` in Keychain using the service name `com.mortitech.treasuryflow.auth`.
- It exposes `saveTokens`, `getAccessToken`, `getRefreshToken`, `hasToken`, and `clearTokens`.

## Session Bootstrap

- `AppRouter` asks `TokenStorage.hasToken()` during `.task` startup.
- If a token exists, the app starts in the authenticated example-list flow.
- If not, the app starts in the login flow.

## Repository Responsibilities

- `AuthRepository` saves tokens after successful auth operations.
- `AuthRepository.logout()` clears tokens.
- `AuthRepository.getCurrentUser()` uses the authenticated `/auth/me` endpoint.
- The default baseline for unauthorized API responses is to clear tokens and return the app to login flow.
- `AppRouter` is the app-level owner that should react to cleared tokens and drive the transition back to login.

## Current Scope

- The generated template persists tokens only.
- It does not scaffold a broader persisted session object, cached profile bootstrap, or automatic refresh retry state machine by default.
