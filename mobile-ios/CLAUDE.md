# iOS - TreasuryFlow

Swift 6 + SwiftUI app generated from this template. It uses MVVM, Observation, async/await, XcodeGen, Keychain-backed token storage, and SwiftData caching for local example data. Building requires a Mac with Xcode 26.

Treat Swift 6 strict concurrency as the baseline:

- ViewModels that drive SwiftUI state should be `@MainActor @Observable` by default.
- Shared app dependencies are injected with SwiftUI environment at the app root; feature screens usually receive ViewModels through initializers.
- The default baseline for `APIError.unauthorized` is to clear stored tokens and return the app to login flow unless the project intentionally adds centralized refresh-and-retry behavior.

## Product knowledge wiki

This project uses a shared product wiki at `knowledge/wiki/` as the single source of
truth for what to build. Before implementing any feature:

1. Read `knowledge/wiki/index.md` — confirm the feature is in `ready-for-dev` or `in-dev`
   status and that `advisory-review` is not `pending`. If `advisory-review` is `pending`,
   stop and inform the human — a board review should happen before implementation.
2. Read `knowledge/wiki/features/[feature-id]-[slug].md` for full context
3. Read `knowledge/wiki/platform-requirements/[feature-id]-mobile-ios.md` for
   iOS-specific implementation requirements
4. Read `knowledge/wiki/api-contracts/[feature-id].md` if this feature has an API surface
5. Check `knowledge/wiki/business-rules/` for rules that apply to this feature
6. Read `knowledge/wiki/design/[feature-id]-[slug].md` for UI design decisions

**Do not implement features without a wiki page.** Ask the human to run the `po-intake`
operation first (Claude: `/po-intake [folder]`, Codex: `$po-intake [folder]`,
Cursor: ask the agent to "run po-intake on [folder]").

If you discover information during implementation that should update the wiki, propose
the update and ask for confirmation before writing, or route a question using the `ask`
command (Claude: `/ask F-XXX "..." --to po`, Codex: `$ask F-XXX "..." --to po`).

## Build And Run

```bash
task mobile-ios:generate-project
task mobile-ios:build
task mobile-ios:test
task mobile-ios:test-unit
task mobile-ios:test-ui
```

## Architecture Summary

The generated iOS slice uses MVVM with a small, explicit structure:

- `treasuryflow/DI/` - `DependencyContainer` composition root
- `treasuryflow/Navigation/` - `AppRouter` auth gate and `Route` enum
- `treasuryflow/Data/Network/` - `APIClient`, `APIEndpoint`, and transport rules
- `treasuryflow/Data/Repository/` - repository protocols plus implementations
- `treasuryflow/Data/Storage/` - `TokenStorage` actor and `CachedExample` SwiftData model
- `treasuryflow/Domain/Model/` - API-aligned models
- `treasuryflow/UI/` - `Auth/`, `Examples/`, `Common/`, and `Theme/`

## Documentation

Treat `mobile-ios/docs/` as the current-state source of truth:

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [docs/guide.md](docs/guide.md) | Overview and entry point into the iOS docs set. |
| [docs/repo-orientation.md](docs/repo-orientation.md) | Fastest way to get oriented in the generated iOS repo. |
| [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) | Layers, DI, state flow, and architectural guardrails. |
| [docs/file-structure.md](docs/file-structure.md) | Root layout and where new files belong. |
| [docs/build-and-environments.md](docs/build-and-environments.md) | XcodeGen, Taskfile, build commands, and runtime config. |
| [docs/networking-and-auth.md](docs/networking-and-auth.md) | `APIClient`, endpoints, auth flow, and contract usage. |
| [docs/session-and-token-storage.md](docs/session-and-token-storage.md) | Keychain storage, router bootstrap, and logout behavior. |
| [docs/navigation-and-screens.md](docs/navigation-and-screens.md) | Routes, auth gating, and current screen inventory. |
| [docs/design-system-and-theme.md](docs/design-system-and-theme.md) | Shared theme tokens and reusable UI patterns. |
| [docs/naming-conventions.md](docs/naming-conventions.md) | File, type, and directory naming rules. |
| [docs/conventions-and-workflow.md](docs/conventions-and-workflow.md) | Daily coding rules and feature-delivery workflow. |

## Cross-Project References

- `shared/api-contracts/openapi.yml` is the primary contract reference for endpoints, payloads, and auth flows.
- `backend/` is the behavior reference when the OpenAPI spec needs clarification.
- `mobile-android/` is useful for product parity and UX intent, but prefer iOS-native solutions when platform conventions differ.


## Workflow: Implementing A New Feature

1. Read `mobile-ios/docs/repo-orientation.md` if you need a quick map of the generated iOS slice.
2. Inspect the closest existing files under `Data/`, `Navigation/`, and `UI/`.
3. Verify backend-facing models and endpoints in `shared/api-contracts/openapi.yml`.
4. Cross-check `backend/` when endpoint behavior or response semantics matter.
5. Cross-check `mobile-android/` when product parity matters.
6. Update only the layers the task needs: models, networking, repositories, router, screens, tests, and docs.
7. Run the smallest sufficient iOS build or test task on Mac.
8. Update affected docs before closing the task.


## Platform Decision Rule

- Think and act like a senior iOS developer first.
- Preserve product and contract parity where it matters.
- Prefer SwiftUI- and Apple-native implementation choices when the Android and iOS approaches should differ.

## Keep Documentation In Sync

When implementation changes affect project memory or workflow, update the matching doc in the same session:

- `mobile-ios/docs/file-structure.md` for directory, file, or module changes
- `mobile-ios/docs/architecture.md` for layer or DI changes
- `mobile-ios/docs/build-and-environments.md` for Taskfile, XcodeGen, scheme, or config changes
- `mobile-ios/docs/networking-and-auth.md` and `mobile-ios/docs/session-and-token-storage.md` for networking, auth, session, or token changes
- `mobile-ios/docs/navigation-and-screens.md` for route or screen changes
- `mobile-ios/docs/design-system-and-theme.md` for shared UI or theme changes
- `mobile-ios/docs/naming-conventions.md` or `mobile-ios/docs/conventions-and-workflow.md` for repo-wide convention changes
- `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or repo-local skills when agent-facing workflow changes

## Local Claude Skills

Project-specific Claude skills live in `.claude/skills/`.

- @.claude/skills/ios-conventions/SKILL.md - repository-wide Swift, SwiftUI, MVVM, DI, navigation, and doc-sync guardrails
- @.claude/skills/ios-build-verify/SKILL.md - choose the smallest sufficient `xcodebuild` or Taskfile validation
- @.claude/skills/ios-feature-delivery/SKILL.md - coordinate multi-layer feature work and pull in companion skills
- @.claude/skills/ios-contract-alignment/SKILL.md - own backend-facing DTO, endpoint, API client, and auth-boundary decisions
- @.claude/skills/ios-testing/SKILL.md - choose between unit and UI coverage, XCTest baselines, and Swift Testing adoption
- @.claude/skills/swiftui-design-system/SKILL.md - own shared SwiftUI design language, components, and screen-pattern reuse

Keep the Codex-native repo skills in `.agents/skills/` semantically aligned with these Claude skills where topics overlap.
