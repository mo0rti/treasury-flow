# Admin Web Portal

Next.js App Router project for internal operations and back-office workflows.

## Product knowledge wiki

This project uses a shared product wiki at `knowledge/wiki/` as the single source of
truth for what to build. Before implementing any feature:

1. Read `knowledge/wiki/index.md` — confirm the feature is in `ready-for-dev` or `in-dev`
   status and that `advisory-review` is not `pending`. If `advisory-review` is `pending`,
   stop and inform the human — a board review should happen before implementation.
2. Read `knowledge/wiki/features/[feature-id]-[slug].md` for full context
3. Read `knowledge/wiki/platform-requirements/[feature-id]-web-admin-portal.md` for
   admin portal-specific implementation requirements
4. Read `knowledge/wiki/api-contracts/[feature-id].md` if this feature has an API surface
5. Check `knowledge/wiki/business-rules/` for rules that apply to this feature
6. Read `knowledge/wiki/design/[feature-id]-[slug].md` for UI design decisions

**Do not implement features without a wiki page.** Ask the human to run the `po-intake`
operation first (Claude: `/po-intake [folder]`, Codex: `$po-intake [folder]`,
Cursor: ask the agent to "run po-intake on [folder]").

If you discover information during implementation that should update the wiki, propose
the update and ask for confirmation before writing, or route a question using the `ask`
command (Claude: `/ask F-XXX "..." --to po`, Codex: `$ask F-XXX "..." --to po`).

This slice is based on the Ingredish back-office web reference app:

- `/admin` route space with protected dashboard pages
- credentials-first auth for operators
- management tables and workflow-oriented screens
- a same-origin `/api/v1/*` proxy for backend calls
- Cloudflare/OpenNext deployment

## Focus Areas

- Keep this slice operational and staff-facing.
- Prefer dashboards, tables, filters, and action modals over marketing components.
- Treat role checks and audit visibility as first-class requirements.
- Keep backend integration centralized through shared API helpers and route handlers.
