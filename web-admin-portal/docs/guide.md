# Admin Web Portal Guide - TreasuryFlow

## Purpose

`web-admin-portal/` is the internal web interface for operators and staff. It should host:

- administrative dashboards and monitoring
- moderation and content-management workflows
- user/support tooling
- operations pages with filters, tables, and action dialogs

## Scaffold Patterns

- protected `/admin` route space
- credentials-based sign-in for operators
- persistent sidebar shell for management workflows
- same-origin `/api/v1/*` proxy for backend calls
- Cloudflare/OpenNext deployment structure

## Suggested Structure

```text
app/
├── admin/
│   ├── (auth)/
│   │   └── login/page.tsx
│   └── (dashboard)/
│       ├── layout.tsx
│       ├── page.tsx
│       ├── users/page.tsx
│       └── content/page.tsx
├── api/
│   ├── auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
│   └── v1/[...path]/route.ts
├── components/
│   ├── layout/
│   └── providers/
└── lib/
    ├── api/
    └── config/
```

## Current Maturity

- This scaffold gives you a coherent internal portal starting point.
- It is intentionally lean compared with a fuller internal operations portal.
- You should extend role checks, domain-specific pages, and operational workflows based on your product.

## Commands

```bash
task web-admin-portal:install
task web-admin-portal:dev
task web-admin-portal:lint
task web-admin-portal:typecheck
task web-admin-portal:build
task web-admin-portal:deploy
```
